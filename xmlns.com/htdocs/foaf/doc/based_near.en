<!-- note: is this mis-specified? perhaps range ought to also be SpatialThing, so we
     can have multiple labels on the same point? -->

<p>The <code>foaf:based_near</code> relationship relates two "spatial 
things"
(anything that can <em>be somewhere</em>), the latter typically
described using the geo:lat / geo:long
<a href="http://www.w3.org/2003/01/geo/wgs84_pos#">geo-positioning vocabulary</a>
(See <a href="http://esw.w3.org/topic/GeoInfo">GeoInfo</a> in the W3C semweb
wiki for details). This allows us to say describe the typical latitute and 
longitude of, say, a Person (people are spatial things - they can be 
places) without implying that a precise location has been given.
</p>

<p>We do not say much about what 'near' means in this context; it is a
'rough and ready' concept. For a more precise treatment, see
<a href="http://esw.w3.org/topic/GeoOnion">GeoOnion vocab</a> design
discussions, which are aiming to produce a more sophisticated vocabulary for 
such purposes.
</p>

<p> FOAF files often make use of the <code>contact:nearestAirport</code> property. This
illustrates the distinction between FOAF documents (which may make claims using <em>any</em> RDF
vocabulary) and the core FOAF vocabulary defined by this specification. For further reading on
the use of <code>nearestAirport</code> see <a 
href="http://rdfweb.org/topic/UsingContactNearestAirport">UsingContactNearestAirport</a> in the 
FOAF wiki.
