<h1>Mapping distributed communities using SVG</h1>

<h3>What is FOAF data?</h3>
<ul>
<li>RDF vocabulary
<li>Namespace
<li>Distributed community
</ul>

<h3>Translating FOAF into FOAFnaut</h3>
<ul>
<li>Why we like SVG
<li>Existing app: FOAFcorp source code
<li>Data-collection - scuttering
</ul>


<h3>Individuals, relationships and communities</h3>
<ul>
<li>Representing individual profiles 
 <ul>
 <li>what ppl post about themselves
 <li>problems of flexible, highly-customised data
 </ul>
<li>Relationships
 <ul>
 <li>nature of relationships
 <li>codepiction
 <li>what ppl post about each other
 </ul>
<li>Communities
 <ul>
 <li>mailing lists and irc channels
 <li>roles, positions and hierarchys
 <li>group profiles
 </ul>
</ul>

<h3>Interaction</h3>
<ul>
<li>Integrating FOAF Authoring tools
<li>Combining divergent tools: web (navigation) with desktop (authoring)
<li>Dovetailing SVG with HTML/Java (??)
</ul>

<h3>Customisation, Identities and group overlap</h3>
<ul>
<li>Integrating customised FOAF data
<li>Customising graphics for a range of styles
<li>"Landscaping"
</ul>

<h3>Security, privacy and data protection</h3>
This is a huge topic that I am not sure we should even attempt to tackle. However, the following are clearly design issues:
<ul>
<li>Enclosing groups
<li>Distance of individual reach through community network should not be beyond authorised groups.
<li>Trusting and verifying FOAF data
<li>Codes of conduct which can be designed into the interface
</ul>


<h3>Usage scenarios</h3>
<ul>
<li>Innovation networks - the FOAF development community
<li>Translating FOAF experience to existing (Business?) communities
<li>FOAF in Community services (healthcare, education etc)
</ul>
