On a good day (and a Unix-like system) this should get you up and
running.


1. install Ruby, http://www.ruby-lang.org/

2. install RubyRDF, ie. squish.rb and basicrdf.rb from
	http://www.w3.org/2001/12/rubyrdf/
    - these will live somewhere like /usr/lib/ruby/1.6/

3. install Redland's Raptor parser (and rdfdump utility)
    - you should be able to run 'rdfdump' on the command line

4. install PostgreSQL (and set up user permissions etc).

5. create a database: createdb rdfweb1 			(*a)

6. create tables for storing RDF: psql rdfweb1 < conf/scutterdb.sql

7. create 'webcache/' and 'webcache/_nt' sub directories if needed (*b)

8. Try running Scutter from top level directory: bin/scutter --scutter

9. If it seems to work (and your postgres table fills up) try
   running a server, bin/rdfweb_server and visit 
   http://localhost:2000/rss/ to see if it found any RSS newsfeeds.

10. see doc/scutter.html for more details.

Notes:

    bin/pathfinder might be of interest. This finds paths thru the 
    FOAF/codepiction graph. Is slower than the Java one that runs on 
    the live site, and doesn't have persistent storage.

TODOs:
*a investigate default encoding at this stage
