<h3>The Basic Idea</h3>

<p>The basic idea is pretty simple. If people publish information
in the FOAF document format, machines will be able to make use of
that information. If those files contain "see also" references to
other such documents in the Web, we will have a machine-friendly
version of today's hypertext Web. Computer programs will be able to
scutter around a Web of documents designed for machines rather than
humans, storing the information they find, keeping a list of "see
also" pointers to other documents, checking digital signatures (for
the security minded) and building Web pages and question-answering
services based on the harvested documents.</p>

<p>So, what is the 'FOAF document format'? FOAF files are just text
documents (well, Unicode documents). They are written in XML
syntax, and adopt the conventions of the Resource Description
Framework (RDF). In addition, the FOAF vocabulary defines some
useful constructs that can appear in FOAF files, alongside other
RDF vocabularies defined elsewhere. For example, FOAF defines
categories such as 'Person', 'Document', 'Image', alongside some
handy properties of those things, such as 'name', 'mbox' (ie. an
internet mailbox), 'homepage' etc., as well as some useful kinds of
relationship that hold between members of these categories. For
example, one interesting relationship type is 'foaf:depiction'.
This relates something (eg. a Person) to an Image. The FOAF demos
that feature photos and listings of 'who is in which picture' are
based on software tools that parse RDF documents and make use of
this properties.</p>

<p>The specific contents of the FOAF vocabulary are detailed in the
<a href="http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/">FOAF namespace document</a>.
In addition to the FOAF vocabulary, one of the most interesting
features of a FOAF file is that it can contain "see Also" pointers
to other FOAF files. This provides a basis for automatic harvesting
tools to traverse a Web of interlinked files, and learn about new
people, documents, services, data...</p>

<h3>Extensions</h3>

<p>FOAF was designed to be extended. So long as each FOAF file is a
well-formed XML document written in valid <a
href="http://www.w3.org/RDF/Validator">RDF syntax</a>, you can say
pretty much whatever you like in it. Most RDF web harvesting tools,
eg. the various 'scutter' programs that explore and index FOAF
documents, won't care about which properties and categories your
file uses, just that they use RDF/XML syntax correctly. This means
we can invent new properties and deploy them pretty cheaply.</p>

<p>Why is this interesting? Because it makes FOAF something more
than a cheap fad for geeks. FOAF could be a basis for an
<em>extensible</em>, <em>standards-based</em> platform for creating
cheap fads for geeks. This is much more fun. Once folk get the hang
of creating extensions to FOAF that don't break the basic syntax of
FOAF (ie. RDF/XML) documents, we could see a whole range of
extensions. Some frivolous, some useful.</p>

<p>A quick and frivolous example. Imagine you wanted to create an
computer-based alarm clock based on FOAF, where instead of an
alarm, your computer played sound samples of your friends (and
friends' friends) shouting "Wake Up, slacker...". FOAF tools
provide most of what you need, ie. tools that harvest information
from your friends' Web sites and aggregate it in a local database.
Except you need to know one more property associated with people
described in FOAF documents. You want to know the URL of an audio
clip (eg. MP3 or WAV) of their "wake up" message. All you need to
do to deploy your FOAF-based alarm clock is to document the syntax
for adding this new piece of information into FOAF documents. Then
install a FOAF harvesting tool, write up some motivating documents,
and produce some demos or applications that make interesting use of
your FOAF extension. For this hypothetical 'FOAFAlarmClock' idea,
this could be a program that periodically harvested sound clips and
used them in an electronic alarm clock. If the tool is useful or
fun enough, and your documentation sufficiently straightforward,
you might find people even use it. In which case, the claim that
FOAF is a platform for cheap fads might gain some
plausibility...</p>

<p>Which brings us back to the need for examples and clear
documentation. Ahem...</p>
