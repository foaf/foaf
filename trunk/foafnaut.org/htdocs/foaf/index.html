<p><strong><big><a href="/foaf/foafnaut.svg">Browse the foaf universe with the foafnaut.</a></big></strong></p>
<p>Enter a persons in the foaf world email address (e.g. <a href="/foaf/foafnaut.svg?email=libby.miller@bristol.ac.uk">libby.miller@bristol.ac.uk</a>, or <a href="/foaf/foafnaut.svg?email=jim@jibbering.com">jim@jibbering.com</a> etc.) and then explore who they know, and are codepicted with.  (It appears Linux ASV versions do not work with the input box, add ?email=danbri@w3.org to the url as an alternative.)</p>
<p>People do not need to have a mailbox published in the foaf world, if they only have the mbox_sha1sum property they will still be shown, and the address you enter into the url will be sha1's in the client, so my server will never see it.</p>
<p>FOAFnaut is based on an original idea by <a href="http://www.grorg.org/2002/10/foafcorp/">Dean Jackson</a>. The look, the feel, the design, indeed just about everything was done by <a href="http://liz.xtdnet.nl/">Liz Turner</a>, I just did what I was told. Much input also came from the <a href="http://rdfweb.org/irc/">RDFWeb IRC people</a>, and I owe all of them many beers.</p>
<p><a href="update.html"><strong>Add your url to the foafnaut world</strong></a></p>
<p>You can <a href="foafnaut.zip">download the foafnaut</a> to view it locally if you wish to change anything on the interface, please submit any patches back to me, a licence for it hasn't yet been agreed, so for now assume you can only do private research on it.  I'll have to ask all my collabrators on what a suitable licence may be  All the data is available on the publically accessible internet, but please do not redistribute, if you want to install a scutter locally get in touch.</p>
