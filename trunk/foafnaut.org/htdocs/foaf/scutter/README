foafnaut scutter installation instructions

Requirements:
 (versions in brackets are ones I use, no idea if others will work.)

  Windows Script Host (2.1?)
  mySQL (3.23?)
  mySQL ODBC driver (3.51?)
  
Install:

  Unzip,
  Create a "cache" directory underneath the foaf/scripts/ directory.
  open up foafcrawler.wsf and set the HOMEDIR variable to whereever 
    you downloaded it to.
  create the mySQL database, run the create.sql, it creates a database
    called rdf etc.  You may want to modify this of course.
  create an ODBC datasource called rdf2 which points to the database
    you created.
  That's hopefuly it, try it, execute:

  cscript foafcrawler.wsf Reset http://jibbering.com/plan2.rdf

  from the command prompt, which should download a few files, then
  complete, check the database with a "select * from urlsnew" and
  "select * from rdf2", hopefully you should have the urls and some
  triples.

Use:

  execute the script with cscript foafcrawler.wsf Reset startURL,
  Reset, empties the database, if you don't want to do this, use False
  here. startURL is the location of a document to start the crawl.

  To delete triples from a particular URL, you use 

  cscript deleteurl.wsf http://....

  You must delete a url, before recrawling it otherwise the provenance will break, and the triples will become un-attributed.


When it doesn't work:

  email me, or catch me on irc:irc.freenode.net#foaf

Licensing:

Licencsing is currently unresolved, presumably have to be GPL as it has GPL dependicies.
