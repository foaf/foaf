<h1>Mapping distributed communities using SVG</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p><a href="http://foafnaut.org/">foafnaut</a> is an application built with SVG for mapping 
distributed communities. 
It uses source FOAF (Friend of a Friend) data, posted at various URL's by community 
members and gathered by scuttering devices to generate maps of personal relationships. 
Who knows whom? What is their relationship? The user starts with a single node which
represents a person, and from there builds a map of the surrounding community landscape.</p>

<p>foafnaut is a work in progress. Therefore, the aim of this presentation is to demonstrate
not only what foafnaut can do now, but also discuss what are the possibilities for the future.</p>

<h3>What is FOAF data?</h3>

<p><a href="http://rdfweb.org/foaf/">Friend of a Friend</a> is an RDF vocabulary which allows 
people to publish information about themselves and ther relationships with others. It is a useful 
tool for defining and managing online communities.</p>
<h4>Distributed community</h4>
<p>Users generate FOAF data and post it at their own url. They then inform their preferred
community device - in this case foafnaut, but it could be one of many foaf browsers available.
In the main, these are hypertext based, or bots. Because the information is distributed 
throughout many urls, users have control their own data.</p>


<h2>Translating FOAF into FOAFnaut</h2>

<p>SVG is particularly suited to mapping FOAF data because it uses an xml protocol which is 
compatible with FOAF. As an open standard, it serves the community which 
develops and uses the FOAF vocabulary, without the need for expensive authoring tools. </p>

<p>foafnaut is based on Dean Jackson's <a href="http://grorg.org/2002/10/foafcorp/">FOAFcorp</a> 
application. To date it has been developed by Jim Ley with graphics by Liz Turner.
SVG graphics are brought to life using Javascript. The interaction model allows nodes to be 
expanded to show all connections, for shortest paths to be plotted between nodes, and for 
information about individual nodes to be displayed.</p>



<h3>Individuals, relationships and communities</h3>

<p>The FOAF vocabulary is highly flexible, and often customized according to what users
wish to express. Therefore, individual FOAF profiles may be unique in format as well as 
content. Presenting such content is a challenge for designers and users.</p>

<h4>Relationships</h4>
<p>Defining and accurately verifying relationships is a problem. What people post about 
each other is rarely verified by both parties. Now, foafnaut shows a distinction between 
"knows", "known by" and "know one another". One way to confirm that two people have
at least met is to include a picture of them together - a co-depiction. The flexible FOAF 
vocabulary, however, allows unlimited possibilities in defining these relationships. This
is a challenge for future versions of foafnaut.</p>

<h4>Communities</h4>
<p>Existing internet communities are often defined in terms of mailing lists, news-groups 
and irc channels. A mailing list can be used to uniquely identify an interconnected group of 
people under a single email address. FOAF data profiling the group can be generated, 
and relationships within the group can be represented in terms of roles, position and
hierarchy.</p>


<h3>Interaction</h3>

<h4>Integrating FOAF Authoring tools</h4>
<p>Problems arise when combining divergent tools. For maximum usability, we need to combine 
navigation (web) tools with authoring (desktop) tools. Current methods are slow and do not 
yield instantaneous results. Some operations can be integrated using HTML or Java.</p>
<h4>Customisation</h4>
<p>One way of dealing with the flexible nature of the vocabulary is to offer a customizable
environment in which individuals and groups can espress themselves in words and graphics.
Within a fixed interaction model, different styles and "landscapes" can develop. Individuals 
can make use of custom iconography, emoticons etc.</p>


<h3>Security, privacy and data protection</h3>

<h4>Protect groups</h4>
<p>Groups should be enclosed such that the distance of individual reach through the community 
network should not extend beyond authorized areas.</p>
<h4>Encourage honorable behaviour</h4>
<p>Raw FOAF data has, of itself, no means of validating or verifying relationships. Therefore
interfaces should encourage dialog and codes of conduct. Naming in FOAF data should be consensual, 
and groups should always choose to "opt in".</p>



<h2>Usage scenarios</h2>
<ul>
<li>Innovation networks - the FOAF development community, and why it works</li>
<li>Information exchange - interconnections as peer-to-peer information conduits</li> 
<li>Applying FOAF data to interconnected documents</li>
<li>Translating FOAF experience to existing communities</li>
<li>FOAF in Community services (health care, education etc)</li>
</ul>
