FoafFinger - @BUILDDATE@

Windows (and probably everything other than mac):

java -Djava.library.path=lib -jar FoafFinger.jar --gui "My Name" me@example.com

Mac and Linux:

./run.sh --gui "My Name" me@example.com

Use --cl rather than --gui for a command line version.

Linux problems:

1) Can't find address of the host

FoafFinger has problems finding the host address on Linux sometimes.
Help it out by running it as:

./run.sh --gui "My Name" me@example.com my.host.name

or

./run.sh --gui "My Name" me@example.com 1.2.3.4

(replace these with your host name or ip address - see /sbin/ifconfig)

2) I can't see anyone, but they're definitely there!

Some linux drivers seem to have a bug and need to be in promiscuous mode to see multicast.
A (dumb) solution is running a packet sniffer (eg tcpdump) which will force that mode.
