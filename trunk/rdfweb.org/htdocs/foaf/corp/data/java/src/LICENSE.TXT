This software is not yet distributed / packaged. I'm working on it!
Hence this filetree and LICENSE.TXT.

I expect to release Scutter under the GPL.

I need to double-check for dependencies etc and relationships to other
packages.

RubyRDF (see http://www.w3.org/2001/12/rubyrdf/) will likely be released
under W3C's Software License (which itself permits subsequent
redistribution under GPL). RubyRDF is _not_ included
here; you have to install it separately. Same goes for othe dependencies.
See doc/scutter.html for more info.

A note on dependencies:
Other packages are optional and replacable (with some tweaking -- this
is alpha release code). Any RDF parser should be usable, so long as it
can be feed a URI + base URI, and return triples. Any SQL store should
be OK so long as it allows self-joins. Any WWW server package should
work for exposing Scutter's database; example code for WebRick and for
SOAP4R is included.
