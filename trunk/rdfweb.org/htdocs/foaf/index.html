    <h3>The Basic Idea</h3>

    <p>The basic idea is pretty simple. If people publish
    information in the FOAF document format, machines will be able
    to make use of that information. If those files contain "see
    also" references to other such documents in the Web, we will
    have a machine-friendly version of today's hypertext Web.
    Computer programs will be able to scutter around a Web of
    documents designed for machines rather than humans, storing the
    information they find, keeping a list of "see also" pointers to
    other documents, checking digital signatures (for the security
    minded) and building Web pages and question-answering services
    based on the harvested documents.</p>

    <p>So, what is the 'FOAF document format'? FOAF files are just
    text documents (well, Unicode documents). They are written in
    XML syntax, and adopt the conventions of the Resource
    Description Framework (RDF). In addition, the FOAF vocabulary
    defines some useful constructs that can appear in FOAF files,
    alongside other RDF vocabularies defined elsewhere. For
    example, FOAF defines categories such as 'Person', 'Document',
    'Image', alongside some handy properties of those things, such
    as 'name', 'mbox' (ie. an internet mailbox), 'homepage' etc.,
    as well as some useful kinds of relationship that hold between
    members of these categories. For example, one interesting
    relationship type is 'foaf:depiction'. This relates something
    (eg. a Person) to an Image. The FOAF demos that feature photos
    and listings of 'who is in which picture' are based on software
    tools that parse RDF documents and make use of this
    properties.</p>

    <p>The specific contents of the FOAF vocabulary are detailed in
    the <a href="http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/">FOAF namespace
    document</a>. In addition to the FOAF vocabulary, one of the
    most interesting features of a FOAF file is that it can contain
    "see Also" pointers to other FOAF files. This provides a basis
    for automatic harvesting tools to traverse a Web of interlinked
    files, and learn about new people, documents, services,
    data...</p>

    <h3>Extensions</h3>

    <p>FOAF was designed to be extended. So long as each FOAF file
    is a well-formed XML document written in valid <a
    href="http://www.w3.org/RDF/Validator">RDF syntax</a>, you can
    say pretty much whatever you like in it. Most RDF web
    harvesting tools, eg. the various 'scutter' programs that
    explore and index FOAF documents, won't care about which
    properties and categories your file uses, just that they use
    RDF/XML syntax correctly. This means we can invent new
    properties and deploy them pretty cheaply.</p>

    <p>Why is this interesting? Because it makes FOAF something
    more than a cheap fad for geeks. FOAF could be a basis for an
    <em>extensible</em>, <em>standards-based</em> platform for
    creating cheap fads for geeks. This is much more fun. Once folk
    get the hang of creating extensions to FOAF that don't break
    the basic syntax of FOAF (ie. RDF/XML) documents, we could see
    a whole range of extensions. Some frivolous, some useful.</p>

    <p>A quick and frivolous example. Imagine you wanted to create
    an computer-based alarm clock based on FOAF, where instead of
    an alarm, your computer played sound samples of your friends
    (and friends' friends) shouting "Wake Up, slacker...". FOAF
    tools provide most of what you need, ie. tools that harvest
    information from your friends' Web sites and aggregate it in a
    local database. Except you need to know one more property
    associated with people described in FOAF documents. You want to
    know the URL of an audio clip (eg. MP3 or WAV) of their "wake
    up" message. All you need to do to deploy your FOAF-based alarm
    clock is to document the syntax for adding this new piece of
    information into FOAF documents. Then install a FOAF harvesting
    tool, write up some motivating documents, and produce some
    demos or applications that make interesting use of your FOAF
    extension. For this hypothetical 'FOAFAlarmClock' idea, this
    could be a program that periodically harvested sound clips and
    used them in an electronic alarm clock. If the tool is useful
    or fun enough, and your documentation sufficiently
    straightforward, you might find people even use it. In which
    case, the claim that FOAF is a platform for cheap fads might
    gain some plausibility...</p>

    <p>Which brings us back to the need for examples and clear
    documentation. Ahem...</p>
