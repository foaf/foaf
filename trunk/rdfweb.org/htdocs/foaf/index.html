    <h3>
      The Basic Idea
    </h3>
    <p>
      The basic idea is pretty simple. If people publish
      information in the FOAF document format, machines will be
      able to make use of that information. If those files contain
      "see also" references to other such documents in the Web, we
      will have a machine-friendly version of today's hypertext
      Web. Computer programs will be able to scutter around a Web
      of documents designed for machines rather than humans,
      storing the information they find, keeping a list of "see
      also" pointers to other documents, checking digital
      signatures (for the security minded) and building Web pages
      and question-answering services based on the harvested
      documents.
    </p>
    <p>
      So, what is the 'FOAF document format'? FOAF files are just
      text documents (well, Unicode documents). They are written in
      XML syntax, and adopt the conventions of the Resource
      Description Framework (RDF). In addition, the FOAF vocabulary
      defines some useful constructs that can appear in FOAF files,
      alongside other RDF vocabularies defined elsewhere. For
      example, FOAF defines categories such as 'Person',
      'Document', 'Image', properties of those things, such as
      'name', 'mbox' (ie. an internet mailbox), 'homepage' etc., as
      well as some useful kinds of relationship that hold between
      members of these categories. One interesting relationship
      type is 'foaf:depiction'. This relates something (eg. a
      Person) to an Image. The FOAF demos that feature photos and
      listings of 'who is in which picture' are based on software
      tools that parse RDF documents and make use of this
      properties.
    </p>
    <p>
      The specific contents of the FOAF vocabulary are detailed in
      the <a href="http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/">FOAF namespace
      document</a>. In addition to the FOAF vocabulary, one of the
      most interesting features of a FOAF file is that it can
      contain "see Also" pointers to other FOAF files. This
      provides a basis for automatic harvesting tools to traverse a
      Web of interlinked files, and learn about new people,
      documents, services, data...
