<h1>rdfweblog example, 2000-09-09</h1>

<p>danbri's semi-fictional weblog for Sept 9th, 2000</p>

<rdfweb:RDFWebLog date="2000-09-09" logger="mailto:danbri@w3.org"

<p>(disclaimer: ok, this is dull. I don't do weblogs! this is just some
example text to play with + explanation... Do a view/src to see the
semantic annotations I'm playing with to allow this sort of narrative 
to be summarised for Semantic Web apps...)
</p>

Today I have been <wordnet:reading>reading</wordnet:reading> the book
<wordnet:book   util:homepage="http://www.cryptonomicon.com/"
title="Cryptonomicon">Cryptonomicon</wordnet:book> much of the day, to
take my mind off the RDF Issues List. Then I 
played for a brain-rotting while on my <wordnetverb:game 
util:homepage="http://www.dreamcast.com/">Dreamcast</wordnetverb:game>
console. Then I watched the <wordnet:Film
util:review="http://www.rottentomatoes.com/movies/titles/mummy/">The
Mummy</wordnet:Film> and read Cryptonomicon while <wordnet:Person
util:mbox="mailto:m.l.poulter@bristol.ac.uk">Martin</wordnet:Person>,
Craig and Liz
watched <wordnet:film util:review="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0118571"
dc:title="Air Force One">Air Force One</wordnet:film>, since the film was
preposterous honk. Now I'm listening to <wordnet:music
util:tracklistChecksum="8c087e0b"
rdfs:seeAlso="http://rdfwebring.org/cgi-bin/cd/describe?8c087e0b">some
music (actually David Bowie's Low, whose tracklistChecksum 
I don't have to hand)</wordnet:music> and chatting in IRC with
<wordnet:Person util:made="http://www.perlxml.com"
util:profile="http://profiles.userland.com/$eisen@pobox.com"> Jonathan
Eisenzopf</wordnet:Person> when I should be getting some sleep...
</p>

<p> We were talking about variations on the weblog idea, the relationship
between that and XHTML 'semantic web screenscraping', and I wanted to show
the weblog extension to the <a
href="http://rdfwebring.org/">rdfwebring</a> system that I've been
designing. Being too verbose for IRC, I wrote it up as this example file.
</p>
<p>
So... here's a sketch of an RDFWebLog data file. The yntax is XML tagged
with significant verbs and named items, which are referenced indirectly,
eg 'the person whose homepage is...' or 'the film reviewed at...', just as
we do in the RDFWebRing.</p>
<p> 
This example sketch is only intended to be evocative of what we might
build with RDF; there are plenty of bugs, and the WordNet representation needs
further thought. Basic idea: we can mention objects through
uniquely-identifying description in our WebLogs. Postprocessing of this
into HTML or into richer RDF representations (eg. based around Event
models such as the <a
href="http://www.ilrt.bris.ac.uk/discovery/harmony/">Harmony Project</a>'s
ABC) should be easy...
</p>

<p>
This example is a strange mix of XHTML and (fictional) rdfweblog markup.
While it seems to render OK in HTML browsers, the objects that I mention
(films etc) don't get hyperlinked. An XSLT transformation into HTML that
used A HREF would do the job, though I suspect some jiggling about with
the way I use XML here might allow a single format to function both as
hypertext XHTML and as something that permits a rich RDF view of the data.
That's the theory anyway...
