      An Introduction to RDFWeb and FOAF
    </h2>
    <p>
      This document introduces the RDFWeb system, providing an
      overview of the technology, ambitions and architecture behind
      the project. While RDFWeb relies heavily on the <a
      href="http://www.w3.org/">W3C</a> specifications for the
      <em>Resource Description Framework</em> (<a
      href="http://www.w3.org/RDF/">RDF</a>), this document stands
      alone as a complete description of the system. A brief
      introduction of the RDF information model is provided for the
      curious.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Status
    </h2>
    <p>
      This document is incomplete. RDFWeb is incomplete. The quick
      start guide hasn't been written yet. The vocabulary is in
      flux. Everything might change. We do however have two running
      RDFWeb implementations, and are now focussing on getting an
      initial stable RDF vocabulary defined so we can scale up the
      effort into a large distributed testbed. The vocab and quick
      start documentation are the most urgently needed. The current
      General Overview document should provide a reasonable
      pespective on what we're doing here, although it is patchy in
      several places.

    <h2>
      What is RDFWeb?
    </h2>
    <p>
      The basic idea behind RDFWeb is simple: the Web is all about
      making connections between things. RDFWeb provides some basic
      machinery to help us tell the Web about the connections
      between the things that matter to us.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thousands of people already do this on the Web by describing
      themselves and their lives on their home page. Using RDFWeb,
      you can help machines understand your home page, and through
      doing so, learn about the relationships that connect people,
      places and things described on the Web. RDFWeb uses W3C's RDF
      technology to integrate information from your home page with
      that of your friends, and the friends of your friends, and
      their friends...
    </p>
    <a id="lExamples" name="lExamples"></a> 
    <h2>
      An example
    </h2>
    <p>
      RDFWeb is best explained with an example. Consider a Web of
      inter-related home pages, each describing things of interest
      to a group of friends. Each new home page that appears on the
      Web tells the world something new, providing factoids and
      gossip that make the Web a mine of disconnected snippets of
      information. RDFWeb provides a way to make sense of all this.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here's an example, a fragment from the mostly-fictional
      RDFWeb database. First we list some facts, then describe how
      the RDFWeb system makes it possible to explore the Web
      learning such things.
    </p>
    <p>
      <small><code>Dan lives in Zetland road, Bristol, UK with
      Libby and Craig. Dan's email address is danbri@w3.org.
      Libby's email address is libby.miller@bris.ac.uk. Craig's is
      craig@netgates.co.uk. Dan and Libby work for an organisation
      called "ILRT" whose website is at http://ilrt.org/. Craig
      works for "Netgates", an organisation whose website is at
      http://www.netgates.co.uk/. Craig's wife Liz lives in Bristol
      with Kathleen. Kathleen and Liz also work at "Netgates".
      Martin knows Craig, Dan and Libby quite well. Martin lives in
      Bristol and has an email address of
      m.l.poulter@bristol.ac.uk. (etc...)</code></small>
    </p>
    <p>
      This kind of information is the sort of thing typically found
      on Web home pages. The extract shown here indicates how
      short, stylised factual sentences can be used to characterise
      a Web of relationships between people, places, organisations
      and documents. In real life, this information would be most
      likely be distributed across variou s Web pages created by
      the individuals listed. Very likely, their pages will link
      directly or indirectly to the home pages of countless other
      friends-of-friends-of-friends.
    </p>
    <a id="lGoals" name="lGoals"></a> 
    <h2>
      Goals
    </h2>
    <p>
      We want a better way of keeping track of the scattered
      fragments of data currently represented in the Web.
    </p>
    <p>
      We want to be able to find documents in the Web based on
      their properties and inter-relationships; we want to be able
      to find information about people based on their publications,
      employment details, group membership and declared interests.
      We want to be able to share annotations, ratings, bookmarks
      and arbitrary useful data fragments using some common
      infrastructure. We want a Web search system that's more like
      a database and less like a lucky dip. We need it to be be
      distributed, decentralised, and content-neutral. RDFWeb, if
      successful, should help the Web do the sorts of things that
      are currently the proprietary offering of centralised
      services.
    </p>
    <p>
      RDF seems to offer a lot of promise in this area. While RDF
      is defined in terms of a rather abstract information model,
      our needs are rather practical. We want to be able to ask the
      Web sensible questions and common kinds of thing (documents,
      organisations, people) and get back sensible results.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        "<em>Find me today's web page recommendations made by
        people who work for Medical organisations</em>".
      </li>
      <li>
        "<em>Find me recent publications by people I've co-authored
        documents with.</em>"
      </li>
      <li>
        "<em>Show me critiques of this web page, and the home pages
        of the author of that critique</em>"
      </li>
      <li>
        etc...
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      All this sounds a bit ambitious (and it is), but we think
      we've a reasonable sense of how to build a linked information
      system with these capabilities.
    </p>
    <a id="lSaying" name="lSaying"></a> 
    <h2>
      Saying things in RDF
    </h2>
    <p>
      This section can be skipped by readers who are not interested
      in the technological underpinnings of RDFWeb.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the Web, one technology we can use to describe various
      kinds of things and their inter-relationships is called
      'RDF', the <em>Resource Description Framework</em>. <a
      href="http://www.w3.org/RDF/">RDF</a> is a relatively new
      specification produced by the <a
      href="http://www.w3.org/">World Wide Web Consortium</a>
      (W3C). Like previous W3C specifications for HTML (Web
      documents), RDF is designed for widespread, decentralised
      use.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the heart of the RDF is an information model based around
      the idea of simple 3-part sentences such as "dan
      hometown-name bristol", or "martin homepage-url
      http://www.glandscape.com/". It turns out that this somewhat
      stilted way of describing things can be very expressive,
      since RDF allows anyone to define new terms such as
      'homepage', 'hometown', 'bestFriendHomepage' and so on. The
      RDFWeb starter vocabulary provides some basic terms such as
      these to provide a common language for machine-readable
      homepages. RDF allows multiple such languages to be mixed
      together - for example, you can use the "Dublin Core"
      vocabulary to describe documents you've written or
      contributed to.
    </p>
    <p>
      The RDFWeb system itself doesn't care much about what you
      say, but about the way in which you say it. By using a
      carefully designed file format and a simple common
      information model, we can build a distributed database in
      which anyone can say anyth ing about anything... By squashing
      our information into the simple 3-part-sentence framework, we
      can build systems that automatically combines such data from
      multiple sources.
    </p>
    <p>
      One page might tell use that "daniel.brickley@bristol.ac.uk
      works-at http://ilrt.org/". Another might tell use that
      "http://ilrt.org/ based-in bristol". On this basis, RDF-aware
      tools such as the RDFWeb system could conclude that the
      person whose email address is daniel.brickley@bristol.ac.uk
      works for an organisation based in Bristol. Other pages might
      tell us more about that individual, or about the city of
      Bristol , or describe other things related to Bristol or
      daniel.brickley@bristol.ac.uk
    </p>
    <p>
      By adopting a common style of representing this kind of data
      to Web-based computer systems, we can start to treat the Web
      as a distributed database containing arbitrary facts (as well
      as lies and half-truths...). RDFWeb was created to explore
      this view of the Web, and to show how practical tools can be
      built around these sometimes abstract ideas. There are a
      number of subtle technical points surrounding the
      practicalities of identifying people, organisations etc. in a
      standard way on the Web. These are discussed in more detail
      when we introduce the RDFWeb starter vocabulary.
    </p>
    <a id="lVocab" name="lVocab"></a> 
    <h2>
      Starter Vocabulary
    </h2>
    <p>
      The starter vocabulary for RDFWeb combines some basic RDF
      vocabulary we invented for the project, plus other useful
      existing vocabulary such as the Dublin Core metadata
      elements.
    </p>
    <p>
      The (pre-publication) <a
      href="http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/">Friend of a Friend
      (FOAF)</a> vocabulary provides the basics. This XML namespace
      defines RDF properties useful for RDFWeb applications.
      Currently these are inadequately documented, and there is
      already some variation and ambiguity in the few testbed data
      files we already have.
    </p>
    <p>
      See also <a href="vocab1.html">vocab scratchpad</a> which
      lists a few possible/likely properties.

      RDFWeb for Users
    </h2>
    <p>
      Q: How do I get started?
    </p>
    <p>
      A: (It Should Be) Easy. Except that we haven't created the
      appropriate HOWTO documents explaining how to contribute. Our
      bad. Asking in the <a href="http://rdfig.xmlhack.com/">RDF
      Interest Group IRC channel</a> might shame us into finishing
      these.
    </p>
    <p>
      Q: What happens then?
    </p>
    <p>
      A: Various RDFWeb tools watch the Web for new files, and
      combine your data into a database along with many other
      similar files. These are available for searching...
    </p>
    <a id="lForDevelopers" name="lForDevelopers"></a> 
    <h2>
      RDFWeb for Developers
    </h2>
    <p>
      Q: Um... how's it work then?
    </p>
    <p>
      A: Everything is represented as fragments of a huge data
      graph, with Web identifiers for relationships between things
      (eg. wife, livesWith etc), and Web identifiers for anything
      we can readily identify, such as homepages, mailboxes. This
      provides an organising principle for blending together data
      from different sources. We can't <em>always</em> tell when
      two people are talking about the same thing, but we can try.
    </p>
    <p>
      How can we represent people to the RDFWeb? Personal mailboxes
      are a good example. They can be used as a way of picking out
      some individual for unambiguous description: for any
      <code>mailto:name@domain.example.com</code> <em>personal</em>
      email address, there's only ever one proper flesh and blood
      owner (theoretically). So RDFWeb can use this kind of fact to
      integrate data.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here's a <a href="danbri-foaf.gif">graphical
      representation</a> of an RDF description for the person who
      has a personal mailbox
      <code>mailto:daniel.brickley@bristol.ac.uk</code>. Note that
      we don't have stable IDs for the people, so RDFWeb software
      will have to do a bit of extra work to integrate and
      normalise this data when it merges it with factoids from the
      RDF home pages of the other people mentioned in the graph. We
      can achieve this through knowing that for any specific value
      of some uniquely identifying property, there can be <em>at
      most one</em> Web-identifiable resource with that property
      value. This trick works for people and email addresses,
      organisations and their home pages, restaurants and their
      telephone numbers and so on.

    <p>
      Privacy/exhibitionism. Who owns what? (idea, database,
      software). Nobody owns the dataset, tools should be
      opensource, idea is trivial. This kind of application is
      pretty obvious once you buy into RDF. Database: each RDF page
      should be freely distributable, though legal nightmare with
      storage of personal data -- need to investigate.
      IPR/copyright over each page? (fair use statement to stop
      spammers harvesting the entire thing?). Basic vocab (see
      notes). Roadmap (event log / lifestream; dig sigs).
      recommendations. sw as scaffolding. How to say 'i like this
      restaurant...' etc. Motivating inference stuff: can we find
      real world uses for transitive relationships, symmetric etc.
      Eg. family tree stuff.
