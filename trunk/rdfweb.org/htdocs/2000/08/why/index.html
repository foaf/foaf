<h2>RDFWeb Intro</h2>

<p>This document introduces the RDFWeb system, providing an
overview of the technology, ambitions and architecture behind the
project. While RDFWeb relies heavily on the <a
href="http://www.w3.org/">W3C</a> specifications for the <em>
Resource Description Framework</em> (<a
href="http://www.w3.org/RDF/">RDF</a>), this document stands alone
as a complete description of the system. A brief introduction of
the RDF information model is provided for the curious.</p>

<h2>Status</h2>

<p>This document is incomplete. RDFWeb is incomplete. The quick
start guide hasn't been written yet. The vocabulary is in flux. Everything
might change. We do however have two running RDFWeb implementations,
and are now focussing on getting an initial stable RDF vocabulary defined
so we can scale up the effort into a large distributed testbed. The vocab
and quick start documentation are the most urgently needed. The current
General Overview document should provide a reasonable pespective on what
we're doing here, although it is patchy in several places.

<a name="lWhat"></a>
<h2>What is RDFWeb?</h2>

<p>The basic idea behind RDFWeb is simple: the Web is all about
making connections between things. RDFWeb provides some basic
machinery to help us tell the Web about the connections between the
things that matter to us.</p>

<p>Thousands of people already do this on the Web by describing
themselves and their lives on their home page. Using RDFWeb,
you can help machines understand your home page, and through doing
so, learn about the relationships that connect people, places and
things described on the Web. RDFWeb uses W3C's RDF technology
to integrate information from your home page with that of your
friends, and the friends of your friends, and their friends...</p>


<a name="lExamples"></a>
<h2>An example</h2>

<p>RDFWeb is best explained with an example. Consider a Web of
inter-related home pages, each describing things of interest to a
group of friends. Each new home page that appears on the Web tells
the world something new, providing factoids and gossip that make
the Web a mine of disconnected snippets of information. RDFWeb
provides a way to make sense of all this.</p>

<p>Here's an example, a fragment from the mostly-fictional
RDFWeb database. First we list some facts, then describe how
the RDFWeb system makes it possible to explore the Web learning
such things.</p>

<p><small><code>Dan lives in Zetland road, Bristol, UK with Libby
and Craig. Dan's email address is danbri@w3.org. Libby's email
address is libby.miller@bris.ac.uk. Craig's is
craig@netgates.co.uk. Dan and Libby work for an organisation called
"ILRT" whose website is at http://ilrt.org/. Craig works for
"Netgates", an organisation whose website is at
http://www.netgates.co.uk/. Craig's wife Liz lives in Bristol with
Kathleen. Kathleen and Liz also work at "Netgates". Martin knows
Craig, Dan and Libby quite well. Martin lives in Bristol and has an
email address of m.l.poulter@bristol.ac.uk. (etc...)
</code></small></p>

<p>This kind of information is the sort of thing typically found on
Web home pages. The extract shown here indicates how short,
stylised factual sentences can be used to characterise a Web of
relationships between people, places, organisations and documents.
In real life, this information would be most likely be distributed
across variou s Web pages created by the individuals listed. Very
likely, their pages will link directly or indirectly to the home
pages of countless other friends-of-friends-of-friends.</p>



<a name="lGoals"></a>
<h2>Goals</h2>

<p>
We want a better way of keeping track of the scattered fragments of data
currently represented in the Web.
</p>


<p>
We want to be able to find documents in the Web based on their properties
and inter-relationships; we want to be able to find information about people
based on their publications, employment details, group membership and
declared interests. We want to be able to share annotations, ratings,
bookmarks and arbitrary useful data fragments using some common
infrastructure. We want a Web search system that's more like a database
and less like a lucky dip. We need it to be be distributed, decentralised,
and content-neutral. RDFWeb, if successful, should help the Web do
the sorts of things that are currently the proprietary offering of
centralised services.
</p>

<p>
RDF seems to offer a lot of promise in this area. While RDF is defined in
terms of a rather abstract information model, our needs are rather
practical. We want to be able to ask the Web sensible questions and common
kinds of thing (documents, organisations, people) and get back sensible
results.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
 "<em>Find me today's web page recommendations made by people who
work for Medical organisations</em>".
</li>

<li>
"<em>Find me recent publications by people I've co-authored documents
with.</em>"
</li>

<li>
"<em>Show me critiques of this web page, and the home pages of the author
of that critique</em>"
</li>

<li>etc...</li>

</ul>

<p>
All this sounds a bit ambitious (and it is), but we think we've a 
reasonable sense of how to build a linked information system with these
capabilities.
</p>





<a name="lSaying"></a>
<h2>Saying things in RDF</h2>

<p>This section can be skipped by readers who are not interested in
the technological underpinnings of RDFWeb.</p>

<p>On the Web, one technology we can use to describe various kinds
of things and their inter-relationships is called 'RDF', the <em>
Resource Description Framework</em>. <a
href="http://www.w3.org/RDF/">RDF</a> is a relatively new
specification produced by the 
<a href="http://www.w3.org/">World Wide Web Consortium</a> (W3C). Like
previous W3C specifications for HTML (Web documents), RDF is
designed for widespread, decentralised use.</p>

<p>At the heart of the RDF is an information model based around the
idea of simple 3-part sentences such as "dan hometown-name
bristol", or "martin homepage-url http://www.glandscape.com/". It
turns out that this somewhat stilted way of describing things can
be very expressive, since RDF allows anyone to define new terms
such as 'homepage', 'hometown', 'bestFriendHomepage' and so on. The
RDFWeb starter vocabulary provides some basic terms such as
these to provide a common language for machine-readable homepages.
RDF allows multiple such languages to be mixed together - for
example, you can use the "Dublin Core" vocabulary to describe
documents you've written or contributed to.</p>

<p>The RDFWeb system itself doesn't care much about what you
say, but about the way in which you say it. By using a carefully
designed file format and a simple common information model, we can
build a distributed database in which anyone can say anyth ing
about anything... By squashing our information into the simple
3-part-sentence framework, we can build systems that automatically
combines such data from multiple sources.</p>

<p>One page might tell use that "daniel.brickley@bristol.ac.uk
works-at http://ilrt.org/". Another might tell use that
"http://ilrt.org/ based-in bristol". On this basis, RDF-aware tools
such as the RDFWeb system could conclude that the person whose
email address is daniel.brickley@bristol.ac.uk works for an
organisation based in Bristol. Other pages might tell us more about
that individual, or about the city of Bristol , or describe other
things related to Bristol or daniel.brickley@bristol.ac.uk</p>

<p>By adopting a common style of representing this kind of data to
Web-based computer systems, we can start to treat the Web as a
distributed database containing arbitrary facts (as well as lies
and half-truths...). RDFWeb was created to explore this
view of the Web, and to show how practical tools can be built
around these sometimes abstract ideas. There are a number of subtle
technical points surrounding the practicalities of identifying
people, organisations etc. in a standard way on the Web. These are
discussed in more detail when we introduce the RDFWeb starter
vocabulary.</p>





<a name="lVocab"></a>
<h2>Starter Vocabulary</h2>

<p>(@@TODO: this is _very_sketchy. Nail down v0.1 and test it!)</p>

<p>
The starter vocabulary for RDFWeb combines some basic RDF vocabulary
we invented for the project, plus other useful existing vocabulary such as
the Dublin Core metadata elements.
</p>

<p>
The (pre-publication) <a href="http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/">Friend of a
Friend (FOAF)</a> vocabulary provides the basics. This XML namespace
defines RDF properties useful for RDFWeb applications. Currently these
are inadequately documented, and there is already some variation and
ambiguity in the few testbed data files we already have.
</p>

<p>
See also <a href="vocab1.html">vocab scratchpad</a> which lists a few
possible/likely properties.
</p>

<a name="lForUsers"></a>
<h2>RDFWeb for Users</h2>

<p>Q: How do I get started?</p>

<p>A: (It Should Be) Easy. Create an RDFWeb document following the
'<a href="../qs/">quick start</a>' guidelines provided here(@@TODO!), and
put it online alongside
your homepage. The guidelines describe how to reference your
RDFWebRing page from your normal homepage, and some other
mechanisms for announcing its existence to the Web.</p>

<p>Q: What happens then?</p>

<p>A: Various RDFWeb tools watch the Web for new files, and
combine your data into a database along with many other similar
files. These are available for searching...</p>


<a name="lForDevelopers"></a>
<h2>RDFWeb for Developers</h2>

<p>Q: Um... how's it work then?</p>

<p>A: Everything is represented as fragments of a huge data graph,
with Web identifiers for relationships between things (eg. wife,
livesWith etc), and Web identifiers for anything we can readily
identify, such as homepages, mailboxes. 
This provides an organising principle for blending together data from different sources.
We can't <em>always</em> tell when two people are talking about the
same thing, but we can try. 
</p>

<p>
How can we represent people to the RDFWeb? Personal mailboxes are a
good example. They can be used as a way of picking out some individual for
unambiguous description: for any
<code>mailto:name@domain.example.com</code>
<em>personal</em>
email address, there's only ever one proper flesh and blood owner
(theoretically). So RDFWeb can use this kind of fact to
integrate data. 
</p>

<p>
Here's a <a href="danbri-foaf.gif">graphical
representation</a> of an RDF description for the person who has a
personal mailbox <code>mailto:daniel.brickley@bristol.ac.uk</code>. Note
that we don't have stable IDs for the people, so RDFWeb software will
have to do a bit of extra work to integrate and normalise this data when
it merges it with factoids from the RDF home pages of the other people
mentioned in the graph. We can achieve this through knowing that for any
specific value of some uniquely identifying property, there can be <em>at
most one</em> Web-identifiable resource with that property value. This
trick works for people and email addresses, organisations and their home
pages, restaurants and their telephone numbers and so on.

<h3>Rough Notes / scratchpad</h3>

<p>(FAQ stuff here...)</p>

<p>Privacy/exhibitionism. Who owns what? (idea, database,
software). Nobody owns the dataset, tools should be opensource,
idea is trivial. This kind of application is pretty obvious once
you buy into RDF. Database: each RDF page should be freely
distributable, though legal nightmare with storage of personal data
-- need to investigate. IPR/copyright over each page? (fair use
statement to stop spammers harvesting the entire thing?). Basic
vocab (see notes). Roadmap (event log / lifestream; dig sigs).
recommendations. sw as scaffolding. How to say 'i like this
restaurant...' etc. Motivating inference stuff: can we find real
world uses for transitive relationships, symmetric etc. Eg. family
tree stuff.</p>
