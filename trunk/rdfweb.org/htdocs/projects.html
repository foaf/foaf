RDFWeb:

<!--#include virtual="ssi/projects"-->

<p>
This page lists as distinct projects a number of interconnected tasks
and ideas associated with RDFWeb. The main focus of work at the moment is
on the core vocabulary (FOAF) and aggregator implementations (Java, Perl).
As this matures, the potential for add-on projects should improve
massively: RDFWeb is intended to be an irresistable tinkertoy for
hackers...
</p>

<p>All RDFWeb developments are discussed on the rdfweb-dev mailing list,
see <a href="dev.html">developer resources</a> for details of this and
nearby IRC channels.</p>

<h3>RDFWeb Vocabulary</h3>

<p>
The initial RDF/XML vocabulary that underpins RDFWeb is called FOAF
("Friend of a Friend"). It is used alongside other vocabularies (RDFCore,
Dublin Core, Wordnet, RSS 1.0) to provide mixed-vocabulary descriptions of
people, organisations, web services and other information resources.

<h3>RDFWeb Services</h3>

<p>
RDFWeb is constructed from a number of services. The basic building blocks
are RDF and XML parsers, and XSLT transformations: this technology is
available "off the shelf". RDFWeb provides authors of such software with a
large, distributed and heterogeneous collection of test files to help them
refine their software. In addition to parsers, RDFWeb agggregation points
require some sort of RDF database support. Again, these aren't a core part
of RDFWeb itself, the idea is to use RDFWeb to help us develop and test
such tools. Currently, we use a couple of systems being developed at ILRT. 
The most visible component of RDFWeb is the Web-based user interface that
presents the aggregated data back to users.

<h3>Security, trust...</h3>

<p>
RDFWeb raises some interesting issues relating to trust and provenance.
We have created a simple RDF vocabulary, <a
href="http://xmlns.com/wot/0.1/">WOT</A> ("web-o-trust") to test some
ideas about the combination of digital signatures with RDF content.
Currently, some RDF files in the RDFWeb have been signed using GPG or PGP;
those files typically contain a pointer to the result of that signing, and
may also contain or point to information about the signer, and claims
about reciprocal key-signing events. The intent here is to provide enough
meta-information to support a variety of trust and provenance strategies.
