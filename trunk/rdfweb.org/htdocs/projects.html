    <h3>
      RDFWeb Projects
    </h3>
    <p>
      RDFWeb isn't really organised into distinct projects, but
      some themes are emerging. This page should evolve into an
      entry point for people interested in what RDFWeb can
      <em>do</em>, rather than the way in which we achieve this.
      The <a href="dev.html">developer resources</a> page provides more
      details on the underlying machinery.
    </p>
    <p>
Until we get FOAF documented, we don't really have any proper sub-projects.
 For now, take a look at
      the <a href="sitemap.html">sitemap listing</a> to see some of
      the areas we've been working in.
    </p>
    <p>
      The most distinct sub-project of RDFWeb at the moment is the
      <em><a href="/2002/01/photo/index.html">co-depiction
      experiment</a></em>. The <em><a
      href="/people/danbri/2001/09/foafcorp/intro.html">FOAFCorp</a></em>
      experiment is another reasonably discrete project. However
      our main initial project, deploying a Web of FOAF documents,
      has yet to be convincingly documented or deployed. As a
      consequence, all the other themes are rather tangled up at
      present...
