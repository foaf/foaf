    <h1>ayf: a disposable foaf harvester</h1>

    <p>Nearby: <a href="/foaf/">FOAF home page</a> | <a
href="ayf-intro.html">who are these people?</a> | <a
href="ruby-run1.html">test run output</a>
</p> 

    <p>This is one to throw away: a quick Perl script which
    traverses a Web of FOAF RDF documents, using Perl regular
    expressions rather than a proper RDF (or even XML+namespaces)
    parser. It starts at a specified URL, and will continue until
    it runs out of documents linked by 'rdfs:seeAlso' references.
    See the <a href="ayf.pl">script source</a> for more details and
    a list of bugs/flaws etc.</p>

    <p>Why do this? It's a zero-hassle install, with no
    dependencies on XML and RDF libraries of any kind. It is very
    rough, doesn't traverse the full FOAF Web, and doesn't make
    much use of the RDF documents it discovers. <em>However</em>,
    it does show the core simplicity of Semantic Web hypertext, and
    should give you an idea of where you could plug in more robust
    infrastructure (RDF parser, database, PGP signature checking),
    and of the kind of applications you could build with such an
    approach (RSS discovery, Web service discovery, distributed
    address books, etc...). Have a look, have fun, have a look for
    something better (eg. see <a
    href="http://usefulinc.com/foaf/">usefulinc's foafbot
    pages</a>).</p>

    <p>The script current outputs an HTML document (which it
    updates continually while harvesting). The output is a proof of
    concept, in this case proving the concept that you can use FOAF
    to find pictures of people.</p>

    <p>The <a href="ayf.pl">Perl script itself</a> and <a
    href="_allyourfoaf.html">sample output</a> are available.</p>
   
    <p>If your FOAF / mugshot doesn't show up, the fault is almost 
    certainly with the ayf.pl script, and not your data. See the 
    copious disclaimers here and in the Perl code for details.
