<h2>RDFWeb and TAP Projects: FOAF, Wordnet, Web services etc.</h2>

<p>This document provides a home page for TAP-based projects that
relate to the RDFWeb project. More general information on TAP is
available from the <a href="http://tap.stanford.edu/">Stanford
project site</a>.</p>

<p>See the <a
href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-rdf-tap/">TAP list
archives for more background</a>. (not yet -- list in progress)</p>

<h3>TAP/RDFWeb Projects</h3>

<p>TAP provides a very useful, and pretty large, database of things
that will likely be of interest to RDF applications on the Web. To
date, RDFWeb apps have used <a
href="http://xmlns.com/2001/08/wordnet/">Wordnet</a> to exploit a
large RDF taxonomy of noun terms. TAP adds to this by providing TAP
identifiers for specific things, such as people, places, etc.</p>

<p>We expect to use TAP in RDFWeb stuff in a number of ways.</p>

<p>In the photo metadata and 'co-depiction' experiments, TAP is
useful as it provides names for 100s of entities such as 'Frank
Sinatra' and 'JFK' who we have previously found difficult to
describe usefully in RDF. It provides a list of actors, which will
help us describe movies. It provides some extensions to RDF Schema,
which will help us evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of the
evolving W3C WebOnt language. Initial ideas for projects include
photo metadata, exploring a framework for integration / mapping
with Wordnet (at least the noun terms we've mapped into RDF
classes).</p>

<h3>Online demo</h3>

<p>Currently there is an experimental installation of TAP running
here. It may not always be available, as it is on a development
machine. It is currently the same as the main services running on
the Stanford site.</p>


<p>
Some files and links. The instance data in the 
current TAP db is dominated by music data. This is likely to change as
TAP grows.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://tapkb.xmlns.com/rdfweb-tap/">RDFWeb TAP
installation</a></li>
<li>300+ main types: <a href="taptypes.txt">taptypes.txt</a> (a quick dump listing
all
used values of rdf:type / tap:instanceOf; all sensible hierarchy is
flattened by the simple query)</li>
<li>ditto for <a href="tapproperties.txt">tapproperties.txt</a> --
or a bunch of them; need  to write Perl to get them all</li>
<li><a href="alltaptypes.txt">all tap types</a>, not just the ones that
are instantiated in the db (approx 6000)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Next steps</h3>

<p>Things to do (at some point, possibly never): stabilise this
installation, fix dud links, tweak RDF representation, figure out
how to use TAP names in reference-by-description (eg. in photo
metadata). Try some squish2sql RDF tools with the TAP KB (which
lives in MySQL, incidentally). Make some RDF dumps available so
folk can stress-test their RDF databases. Investigate the TAP
GetData() interface, via SOAP, HTTP, discuss on TAP list (when set
up) whether it's OK as is or needs tweaking.</p>
