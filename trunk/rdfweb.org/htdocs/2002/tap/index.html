<h2>RDFWeb and TAP Projects: FOAF, Wordnet, Web services etc.</h2>

<p>This document provides a home page for TAP-based projects that
relate to the RDFWeb project. More general information on TAP is
available from the <a href="http://tap.stanford.edu/">Stanford
project site</a>.</p>

<p>See the <a
href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-rdf-tap/">TAP list
archives for more background</a>. (not yet -- list in progress)</p>

<h3>TAP/RDFWeb Projects</h3>

<p>TAP provides a very useful, and pretty large, database of things
that will likely be of interest to RDF applications on the Web. To
date, RDFWeb apps have used <a
href="http://xmlns.com/2001/08/wordnet/">Wordnet</a> to exploit a
large RDF taxonomy of noun terms. TAP adds to this by providing TAP
identifiers for specific things, such as people, places, etc.</p>

<p>We expect to use TAP in RDFWeb stuff in a number of ways.</p>

<p>In the photo metadata and 'co-depiction' experiments, TAP is
useful as it provides names for 100s of entities such as 'Frank
Sinatra' and 'JFK' who we have previously found difficult to
describe usefully in RDF. It provides a list of actors, which will
help us describe movies. It provides some extensions to RDF Schema,
which will help us evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of the
evolving W3C WebOnt language. Initial ideas for projects include
photo metadata, exploring a framework for integration / mapping
with Wordnet (at least the noun terms we've mapped into RDF
classes).</p>

<h3>Online demo</h3>

<p>Currently there is an experimental installation of TAP running
here. It may not always be available, as it is on a development
machine. It is currently the same as the main services running on
the Stanford site.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://tapkb.xmlns.com/rdfweb-tap/">RDFWeb TAP
installation</a></li>
<li><a href="taptypes.txt">taptypes.txt</a> (a quick dump listing all
values of rdf:type / tap:instanceOf; all sensible hierarchy is
flattened by the simple query)</li>
<li>ditto for <a href="tapproperties.txt">tapproperties.txt</a> (the TAI
web interface probably offers these lists, but having a quick SQL hack
to get to them is handy too)</li>

</ul>

<h3>Next steps</h3>

<p>Things to do (at some point, possibly never): stabilise this
installation, fix dud links, tweak RDF representation, figure out
how to use TAP names in reference-by-description (eg. in photo
metadata). Try some squish2sql RDF tools with the TAP KB (which
lives in MySQL, incidentally). Make some RDF dumps available so
folk can stress-test their RDF databases. Investigate the TAP
GetData() interface, via SOAP, HTTP, discuss on TAP list (when set
up) whether it's OK as is or needs tweaking.</p>
