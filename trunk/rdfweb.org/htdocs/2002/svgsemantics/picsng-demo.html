    <p>
      The sekret truth about RDF, SVG and internet content
      filtering...
    </p>
    <p>
      Here's a quick demo showing the use of RDF combined with SVG
      in a way that supports a classic Web application: internet
      content filtering in the style of <a
      href="http://www.w3.org/PICS/">PICS</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      RDF was designed as fancier successor to PICS. Here we show
      how RDF plus SVG annotations can be used to describe regions
      of an image, and then how SVG transformations can be used to
      tastefully filter out allegedly "rude" regions of digital
      images. Amusingly, pretty much the same technology could be
      applied in the contrary direction, supporting discovery and
      indexing of certain kinds of content. That's why
      anti-censorship folk shouldn't get their knickers in a twist
      about this...
    </p>
    <p>
      Anyway, the demo. It's just a bunch of files, really...
    </p>
    <p>
      To really appreciate this, you'll need a Web browser that
      supports SVG graphics. The <a
      href="http://www.adobe.com/svg/viewer/install/">Adobe
      plugin</a> is probably what you want. I should make some 
screenshots or JPEG-rasterized version of the final output for 
the SVG impaired. Someday.

    <h3>
      SVG/RDF PICS NG demo
    </h3>


    <p>
      Basic idea: there's some photo online, some folk might not
      want to see bits of it 'cos it depicts naked body parts.
      Others might want bits of it blurred/filtered in case
      innocent children were corrupted by it. RDF and SVG to the
      rescue...
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <a
        href="http://swordfish.rdfweb.org/photos/2002/05/31/002120.JPG">
        Some JPEG image in the Web</a> (<a href="picsdemo/002120.JPG">local copy</a>)
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="picsdemo/rdf-taboo.rdf">An RDF/XML file
        describing it</a> (in some detail)
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="picsdemo/rdf-taboo.nt">N-Triples representation
        of this RDF description</a>
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="picsdemo/aboutimage.rb">A simple script (in Ruby)
        that reads this description and generates textual and SVG
        output</a>
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="picsdemo/sampleoutput.txt">sample plain text
        output from (old version of) script</a>
      </li>
      <li>
        finished product: <a
        href="picsdemo/sample_filtered_output.svg">Filtering SVG
        annotation of the image</a> (<a href="picsdemo/picsman-filtered.jpg">Jpeg version</a>)
      </li>
    </ul>

<img width="200" height="245" align="right" src="picsdemo/picsman-filtered-sm.jpg" alt="FamilyFilter'd image" />

    <p>

      So once more, slowly, here's what is happening. We have an
      image. We write (using Jim Ley's <a
      href="http://www.jibbering.com/">neat tools</a>) some RDF
      describing the types of thing depicted in the image,
      including -- <em>crucially</em> -- a description of which bit of
      the image depicts which thing. We load this into an RDF
      program, aboutimage.rb (using the <a
      href="http://www.w3.org/2001/12/rubyrdf/">RubyRDF</a>
      library, see experimental <a
      href="picsdemo/rubyrdf-0.9.deb">Debian package</a>). The RDF
      program simply loops through the list of all the described
      sub-regions of the image, and checks to see what type or
      class of thing each depicted object is. If the thing is
      deemed 'rude', by the simpleminded process of looking in the
      RDF description to see if there is a 'rudeThing' property of
      the class with a value of 'true', then an SVG filter is
      emitted. The generated SVG takes the outlining path info from
      the RDF and tastefully overlays the photo with a filter
      hiding any rudeness from innocent bystanders. That's it,
      really.
    </p>
    <h3>
      What this shows...
    </h3>
    <p>
     RDF and SVG combined can do something neither achieve
      alone: describe images and their parts in pretty
      sophisticated detail.
    </p>
    <p>
      The filtering strategy shown is way too simplistic. Take
      our actual example here. The RDF filtering code can be as
      simple or as complex as we care to implement. The current
      demo implicitly takes the view that certain types of thing
      just are 'rude', and generates image filters accordingly.
      Others might object on the basis that this particular image,
      for example, depicts an Art Happening. That's just fine, we
      could write this in RDF, if we cared, and write smarter
      filters. We could write that the image is a depction of an
      ArtisticEvent called "Taboo" written and performed by Trevor
      Stuart, at the Bath Fringe Festival 2002.
    </p>
    <p>
      Maybe we should extend the demo to do just this.
    </p>
    <h3>
      Conclusions
    </h3>
    <p>
      RDF and SVG will be used on the Semantic Web for...
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Describing and locating images of various kinds
      </li>
      <li>
        Hiding, filtering and avoiding images of various kinds
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The same technology works for both applications. Unexpected
      Bargain. PICS NG...
