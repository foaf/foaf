Some experiments with SVG/RDF, using photo from 'Taboo' performance art thing in Bath.

English people are so easily shocked.

Things to try:

 * making the RDF API nicer on basis of these scripts 
 * making an 'accessibility' demo that uses the wordnet types to describe the image
 * making a 'PICS-NG' demo that detects rude bits of the image and blurs them out 
   (using Batik toolkit?)
 * representing relationships between the depicted objects (partOf etc)
