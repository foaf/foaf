      Vapourware 2002! RDFWeb site finally updated...
    </h2>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        So we've finally updated the <a
        href="http://rdfweb.org/">RDFWeb</a> Web site. Lots of
        things missing, still, but this is the first revamp of the
        site since the site, prototypes and rdfweb-dev mailing list
        went public in June 2000.
      </p>
      <p>
        The purpose of this site was always to provide interesting
        ideas, tools and data for RDF developers, while also
        presenting ideas, projects and services of interest to a
        more general audience. In the last year or so, we've spent
        less time on the project than we'd have liked; in
        particular, the old Web site sucked.
      </p>
      <p>
        So now we're launching a prettier version of the RDFWeb
        vapourware site. We're still missing out on 'Getting
        started HOWTOs', FAQs, template FOAF documents etc., but we
        do at least now have a pretty background graphic. We also
        have the beginnings of a distinction between "RDFWeb for
        developers" (people from the RDF, XML and Web tech
        community) and "RDFWeb for the real world", ie. practical,
        mischievous and infeasible projects that might just be more
        interesting than the underlying technology. The <a
        href="/dev.html">developers</a> and <a 
        href="/projects.html">projects</a> links in the toolbar may
        eventually live up to this ambition.
      </p>
      <p>
        Right now, RDFWeb is very definitely a 'tech' project. It has
        a relatively small audience
        (developers, standards geeks and friends) and it takes a <em>lot</em> of background
        knowledge for granted. But some of the things we've
        prototyped in the last year or so, such as the friend of a
        friend stuff and the co-depiction image metadata
        experiment... these seem to have potential. The new site,
        as it evolves, will try to make these things more
        accessible to a wider audience.
      </p>
      <p>
        Time will tell. It seems smarter to publish this skeletal
        site as-is rather than wait until everything's finished. I
        want to publish the new <a
        href="2002/01/photo/index.html">co-depiction writeup</a>
        anyway, so may as well flip the switch on the whole
        thing...
