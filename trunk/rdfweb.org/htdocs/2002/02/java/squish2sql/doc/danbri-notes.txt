for stanford sha code, and picked out the bits of rdfquery.jar that
are actually needed (see doc/ notes).


Can now use Squish2SQL as a commandline filter. 

Querying via PostgreSQL client tool:

	make query1 | psql codepict
	make query2 | psql test1
	make query3 | psql test2


Querying via JDBC (pass in 'search' as 3rd argument to java Squish2SQL)

	make search1
	make search2 
	make search3
