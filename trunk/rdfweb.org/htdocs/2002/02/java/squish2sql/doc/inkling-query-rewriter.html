      Inkling: Squish-to-SQL rewriter

    <h1>
      Inkling Squish-to-SQL query rewriter
    </h1>
    <p>
      This tool takes a Squish query and transforms it into an SQL
      query targeted at a certain style of RDF database implemented
      in SQL. It was written by Libby Miller
      &lt;libby.miller@bristol.ac.uk&gt; based on a PHP version by
      Matt Biddulph &lt;matt@picdiary.com&gt;. See the <a
      href="rewriter-details.html">how it works</a> document for
      internal details.
    </p>

      Some other RDF query tools, either systems that can consume
      Squish or Squish-ish syntax, or that help with building
      Squish2SQL-based applications.

    <h2>
      Quick Start
    </h2>
    <p>
      To get started really fast on machine with Java installed:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Know about RDF and Squish-ish query languages.
      </li>
      <li>
        Download the <a href="../jars/rewrite-helpers.jar">minimal
        install JAR file</a> from the <a href="../">web site</a>.
      </li>
      <li>
        Make sure Java can find it! Add the JAR to your classpath
        (or use -cp as below)
      </li>
      <li>
        Use it to transform Squish to SQL by typing 'java
        Squish2SQL' followed by the name of a text file containing
        a Squish query.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      <strong>Troubleshooting</strong>: there is no good formal
      spec for Squish yet, and the Java parser has some issues. Try
      tweaking your query slightly.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Java class dependencies
    </h2>
    <p>
      The rewriter is implemented in Squish2SQL.java and uses
      org.desire.rudolf.query.ParsedQuery to represent the Squish
      query, along with some helper classes. Squish2SQL was part of
      the Inkling class hierarchy but is currently given an
      unqualified name. See the <a href="../Makefile">Makefile</a>
      for commandline example usage.
    </p>
    <p>
      It should have pretty minimalistic dependencies, since it
      basically performs a text format conversion. The current
      version depends on PostgreSQL's JDBC libraries (pgjdbc2.jar)
      since it can perform search, in addition to converting
      between query syntaxes. The remaining dependencies are
      documented below.
    </p>
    <h3>
      Required Inkling classes
    </h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        org.desire.rudolf.query.ParsedQuery (slight change from CVS
        version, slimmed the imports)
      </li>
      <li>
        org.desire.rudolf.util.ErrorLog
      </li>
      <li>
        org.desire.rudolf.util.SearchReplace
      </li>
      <li>
        org.desire.rudolf.rdf.Triple
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>
      Classpath and JARs
    </h3>
    <p>
      So basically you need Inkling on your classpath, plus the
      PostgreSQL JDBC classes. For a minimalist install, especially
      if you don't intend to do any actual database querying, ie.
      just run this as a text file, you don't need anything except
      the <a
      href="../jars/rewrite-helpers.jar">rewrite-helpers.jar</a>
      JAR file. This includes only the 4 Inkling classes needed
      (plus their .java src).
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
      Standalone jar usage: java -cp jars/rewrite-helpers.jar
      Squish2SQL squish-filename
    </p>
    <h3>
      Example Usage
    </h3>
<pre>
cat sql/test1.squish

   SELECT  ?thumb, ?name, ?mbox 
   WHERE 
     (foaf::depiction ?x ?uri) 
     (foaf::depiction ?z ?uri) 
     (foaf::mbox ?x mailto:libby.miller@bristol.ac.uk) 
     (foaf::mbox ?z ?mbox) 
     (foaf::name ?z ?name) 
     (foaf::thumbnail ?uri ?thumb) 
     (dc::description ?uri ?dd)  
   USING 
     foaf for http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/  
     dc for http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/


java -cp jars/rewrite-helpers.jar Squish2SQL sql/test1.squish
 
   SELECT DISTINCT 
    b2.value AS mbox, b5.value AS thumb, b7.value AS name  
   FROM   
    triples a1,  triples a2,  triples a3,  triples a4,
    triples a5,  triples a6,  triples a7,  
    resources b2,  resources b5,  resources b7  
   WHERE a1.predicate = '116868652'  
   AND   a2.predicate = '116868652'  
   AND a3.predicate = '1547507681'  
   AND    a3.object = '1145937192'  
   AND a4.predicate = '1547507681'  
   AND    a5.predicate = '1577895888'  
   AND a6.predicate = '-1848367484' 
   AND a7.predicate = '-221079518'  
   AND a1.subject=a3.subject   
   AND a1.object=a2.object  
   AND a2.object=a6.subject  
   AND a6.subject=a7.subject  
   AND a2.subject=a4.subject  
   AND a4.subject=a5.subject  
   AND b2.key=a4.object  
   AND b5.key=a6.object  
   AND b7.key=a5.object ;

</pre>
    <p>
      Appending 'search dbname' will result in it attempting to
      actually do the query against a localhost PostgreSQL database
      called 'dbname'. Piping the output into 'psql dbname' can be
      used to similar effect, if you have the PostgreSQL client
      tool installed.
    </p>
    <h3>
      Availability
    </h3>
    <p>
      The required class libraries from Inkling have been packaged
      as .jar files: <a
      href="../jars/rdfquery.jar">jars/rdfquery.jar</a> (the normal
      Inkling distribution) or just the three classes we need: <a
      href="../jars/rewrite-helpers.jar">jars/rewrite-helpers.jar</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hmm, should probably bundle the revised rewriter (Squish2SQL,
      previously PQ2SQL.java) in there too.
