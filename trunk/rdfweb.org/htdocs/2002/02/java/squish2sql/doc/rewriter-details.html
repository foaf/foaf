trying to clean it up so clearer what is going on.

NB this version uses 2 tables:


              Table "triples"
 Attribute  | Type               | Modifier
------------+-------------------+----------
 subject    | integer           |
 predicate  | integer           |
 object     | integer           |
 assertid   | character varying |
 personid   | character varying |
 isresource | boolean           |

Indices: obj_index,
         pred_index,
         sub_index


            Table "resources"
 Attribute | Type              | Modifier
-----------+-------------------+----------
 key       | integer           |
 value     | character varying |

Indices: res_key_index,
         res_val_index,
         resources_key_key


this is how it works (-ish)

The triples table is like a triples buvcket. for an sql query to work we have to somhow
join up the variables in one row with those in another, which are in face the same
variable from our query.

e.g. suppose we are looking for

(?x title ?y)
(?x description ?z)

the answers to these will be different rows in the database

row 1: #document title "doc 1"
row 2: #document description "what a fantastic document!"

but document is the same thing in each case, and we need to impose that as a constraint
in our SQL query.
We also need to be able to distinguish row 1 from row 2 in our query because the value
for the predicate in each row is different in each case, but the name of the column is
the same in each case ('predicate').

so we treat each separate subclause of the query as a separate virtual table of the
database, and give it a name, a1, a2 etc.

because of this we also need to craete a mapping form the real variable names we want
returned and the names we've given them in the virtual tables

select a1.subject as x, a1.object as y, a2.object as z
from
a1 triples, a2 triples
where
a1.predicate='title'
and
a2.predicate='description'


we need to tell it that a1.subject and a2.subject have to be the same thing, like this:

and
a1.subject=a2.subject

This would give us the results we wanted if the triples table was just a bucket of
strings, but hee we are using sh1 ints in the triples table, mapped to their real string
values in the resources table.

So we need to get their string values form the resources table, using similar techniques.
The full query is then

select b1.value as x, b2.value as y, b3.value as z
from
b1 resources, b2 resources, b3 resources,
a1 triples, a2 triples
where
a1.predicate='title'
and
a2.predicate='description'
and
a1.subject=a2.subject
and
b1.key=a1.subject
and
b2.key=a1.object
and
b3.key=a2.oject;

so we need to do a bunch of stuff in this method:

* map resource values to triple values in terms of the sql valuable names a1, b2 etc
* map real variable names (things we want back) to the sql variable names
* keep a list of which values within the virtual tables must be equal, including triple
to triple and resource to resource.
* keep a list fo the viirtual tables we want to return things from

so moving from triples-bucket'o'strings to sha1 technique complexifies things, but doesnt
really change the technique.

trying to make it use Sha1...
i.e. one table of triples containing only ints, another table of int-resource
or literal mapping

this means that the select variable has to come from this second table
(resources). not sure how to handle string matching.

an attempt at a copy of triple.inc in java - i.e. a function that
translates squish queries to SQL simple triple format

thanks to Matt Biddulph &lt;matt@picdiary.com&gt; who did the orginal
php version

This is arather cruddy copy, although it seems to work.
