<h2>RDFWeb Scutter HOWTO / developer roadmap</h2>

<h3>12 Step Programme</h3>

<ul>
<li>Load some RDF file from URL into an RDF database</li>

<li>...and check for rdfs:seeAlso properties</li>

<li>...and load those files too (and repeat, eg. twice)</li>

<li>Use some RDF API to make HTML/Web interface to this data, eg.
representing people, documents, organisations, photos etc.
described in the RDF.</li>

<li>Implement some 'smushing' techniques to defragment the data,
ie. folding together different descriptions of the same thing by
knowing which RDF properties are uniquely identifying (ie.
'UnambiguousProperties'). Encourage your RDF toolkit/database
vendor or opensource project to ship such facilities as standard
(showing a running app may help).</li>

<li>Implement some provenance-tracking facilities, so that for each
scuttered / indexed RDF document, your database system knows
how/where the data was acquired. Record the means of acquisition
(URI dereference, mail mid: etc), parameters (HTTP content
negotiation etc), date and time. Check digital signature of
document if relevant, recording fingerprint of signing key.
Encourage your RDF toolkit/database vendor or opensource project to
ship such facilities as standard (showing a running app may
help).</li>

<li>Improve the HTML/WWW interface to exploit any additional
information (6) provides. Take care to offer mechanisms that allow
information to be removed/hidden if people ask, and to respect
relevant data protection laws.</li>

<li>Add some more gadgets to the user interface, such as
foaf:humanGenomeChecksum, foaf:geekCode, foaf:archNemesis and other
follies.</li>

<li>Improve the smushing to user smarter heuristics, like
collections of properties which when taken together are uniquely
identifying. Have the system read its config from these from the
Web. Encourage your toolkit/database friends to provide these as
standard, if you can show them to be useful.</li>

<li>Implement some interesting bits of the DAML+OIL or WebOnt:
inverseProperty, UniqueProperty. And rdfs:subPropertyOf,
rdfs:subClassOf, rdf:member etc from RDF/RDFS. Enjoy.</li>

<li>Implement substring based searching, phrase search etc., by
writing out text files that Z39.50 or other digital library
indexing tools can use. Integrate these as backends behind an RDF
API.</li>

<li>See if it scales.</li>
</ul>
