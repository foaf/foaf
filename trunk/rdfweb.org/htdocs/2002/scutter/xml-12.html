RDFWEb Scutter HOWTO / developer roadmap


(1) Load some RDF file from URL into an RDF database

(2) ...and check for rdfs:seeAlso properties

(3) ...and load those files too (and repeat, eg. twice)

(4) Use some RDF API to make HTML/Web interface to 
    this data, eg. representing people, documents, 
    organisations, photos etc. described in the RDF.
    

(5) Implement some 'smushing' techniques to defragment
    the data, ie. folding together different
descriptions of the same thing by 
knowing which RDF properties are uniquely identifying
(ie. 'UnambiguousProperties'). Encourage your RDF
toolkit/database vendor or opensource project to ship
such facilities as standard (showing a running app may
help).

(6) Implement some provenance-tracking facilities, so
that for each scuttered / indexed RDF document, your
database system knows how/where the data was acquired.
Record the means of acquisition (URI dereference, mail
mid: etc), parameters (HTTP content negotiation etc),
date and time. Check digital signature of document if 
relevant, recording fingerprint of signing key.
Encourage your RDF toolkit/database vendor or opensource 
project to ship such facilities as standard (showing a
running app may help).

(7) Improve the HTML/WWW interface to exploit
any additional information (6) provides. Take care to
offer mechanisms that allow information to be
removed/hidden if people ask, and to respect relevant
data protection laws.

(8) Add some more gadgets to the user interface, such as 
foaf:humanGenomeChecksum, foaf:geekCode,
foaf:archNemesis and other follies.

(9) Improve the smushing to user smarter heuristics,
like collections of properties which when taken together
are uniquely identifying. Have the system read its
config from these from the Web. Encourage your
toolkit/database friends to provide these as standard,
if you can show them to be useful.

(10) Implement some interesting bits of the DAML+OIL or
WebOnt: inverseProperty, UniqueProperty. And
rdfs:subPropertyOf, rdfs:subClassOf, rdf:member etc from
RDF/RDFS. Enjoy.

(11) Implement substring based searching, phrase search
etc., by writing out text files that Z39.50 or other 
digital library indexing tools can use. Integrate these 
as backends behind an RDF API.

(12) See if it scales.
