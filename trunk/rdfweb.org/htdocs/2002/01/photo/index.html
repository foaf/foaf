        Overview

      <p>
        This document is intended to provide an illustrated
        walkthrough of the RDFWeb distributed photo-metadata
        experiment. Right now it is pretty bare, but hopefully will
        give you an idea of what we're attempting.

      <h3>
        Introducing RDFWeb with photo metadata
      </h3>
      <p>
        RDFWeb is intended to be both fun and technically
        challenging. We hope that at least some of the writing here
        will be accessible for a general audience, although much of
        it will be for the rather small community familiar with the
        subtleties of various Semantic Web technologies. We're
        trying to build a linked information system, RDFWeb, as a
        way of connecting these two goals. In particular, we want
        RDF to present practical and interesting applications for
        the Semantic Web, and explore ways of making them real. One
        of our favourite examples is <em>photo metadata</em>. This
        document tries to explain why...
      </p>
      <h3>
        The Semantic Web
      </h3>
      <p>
        The (soon to be "Semantic") Web, if it is to reach its full
        potential, needs to become a lot more <em>automatic</em>.
        We hope that it will be able to do things (offer us
        <em>services</em>) based on combining data and services
        scattered around the Web. It might, for example, be able to
        find the phone numbers or AOL screen names of all your
        friends and professional collaborators. Or show you the
        photos, names and recent publications and shared bookmarks
        for everyone attending the next meeting in your calendar.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are so many things the Web <em>might</em> usefully do
        in the future, that it is sometimes hard to see how we can
        get there from here. W3C's RDF has been around since 1997,
        yet while it has been adopted in a number of applications
        (for example by Mozilla, Open Directory, Adobe, RSS 1.0),
        people often ask why there is as yet no <em>killer app</em>
        for RDF. While we're not sure that 'killer app' is the
        right way to think about the problem, it is true that there
        is relatively little RDF data 'out there in the public
        Web', in the way that HTML is 'out there'.
      </p>
      <p>
        The original idea behind RDFWeb was to experiment with
        making some cheap, simple RDF-based document formats that
        were designed for deployment in the public Web. We began by
        asking 'What would it be like if machines could read my
        homepage?', and by prototyping a simple vocabulary called
        <a href="http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1">FOAF</a> ('Friend of a
        Friend'). The FOAF vocabulary provided a way for RDF
        documents to talk about people and their characteristics.
        FOAF documents also make use of <em>hypertext</em>,
        providing '<code>seeAlso</code>' links to other FOAF
        documents elsewhere in the Web. This simple convention
        makes it possible for RDF indexing tools to explore an
        <em>(RDF)Web</em> of linked documents (hence the name of
        the project).
      </p>
      <h3>
        From foaf:knows to foaf:depiction
      </h3>
      <p>
        Shortly after prototyping our early RDFWeb/FOAF tools, we
        ran into a design problem. The FOAF vocabulary initially
        tried to define a number of basic relationships that could
        be used to describe connections between people in the Web.
        We experimented with variations such as
        <code>foaf:knows</code>, <code>foaf:friend</code> and
        <code>foaf:knowsWell</code>. Eventually we decided that
        such a taxonomy was neither appropriate nor deployable; we
        now simply use <code>foaf:knows</code>. Instead of trying
        to categorise subtle relationships into broad classes, we
        took a different approach, focussing instead on other
        information about people. Documents they'd written (and who
        they were written with); Photo's they'd taken (and who
        they'd taken them of). We expanded the early FOAF support
        for image metadata by introducing the notion of a
        <code>foaf:depiction</code>. This relates something (eg. a
        person) to some depiction of them (typically a digital
        image).
      </p>
      <h3>
        Co-Depiction
      </h3>
      <p>
        The co-depiction experiment grew naturally out of this. If
        we knew who was depicted in an image, we could explore a
        Web of relationships between people that were
        'co-depicted'. Two people are co-depicted if there exists
        some digital image that depicts them both.
      </p>
      <p>
        This turned out to be quite fun. Cataloguing digital images
        is expensive and time consuming, but when we focus on
        co-depiction metadata we create a family of documents that
        become more interesting whenever a new document is added to
        the Web. And because we're using hypertext
        <code>seeAlso</code> links between RDF documents, the
        co-depiction data can be scattered around the Web, and
        harvested when required by indexing tools.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Examples
      </h3>
      <p>
        While we have a <a
        href="http://swordfish.rdfweb.org/discovery/2001/08/codepict/">
        working prototype</a>, documentation is currently rather
        scarse. But the basic idea is simple: use a certain form of
        RDF to describe images and the people in them. And the
        wider goal should hopefully be clear: build a distributed
        RDF document collection that illustrates the value of
        connectedness.
      </p>
      <p>
      </p>
      <h2>
        Example co-depiction paths
      </h2>
      <p>
        Here's an example path through photos from me to Frank
        Sinatra. Some of these photos are described in RDFWeb
        already, others I just found using <a
        href="http://images.google.com/">Google image search</a>.
        There are many other paths through the image collection
        than the one shown here, which occured to me after I found
        the picture of clinton and timbl
      </p>
      <p>
        Note: we don't have RDF to describe all these images yet.
        In fact, this particular example presents a challenge,
        since the usual RDFWeb/FOAF strategy for identifying
        individuals (indirectly, via homepage, email address etc.)
        may not work for some of the people depicted here.

        Fancy stuff
      </h3>
      <p>
        Just having a database of images and people built from
        collecting diverse RDF documents is fun. But there are some
        other distracting ideas that we hope to find time to
        implement properly.
      </p>
      <h4>
        Who's who?
      </h4>
      <p>
        The basic system outlined above works by describing an
        image. It would be good to know more. For example, which
        part of the image depicts which person. We think we know
        how to do this...
      </p>
      <p>
        <img src="svg/charles-danbri-amaya-sm.jpg"
        alt="charles and danbri" align="right" width="132"
        height="102" /> <img
        src="svg/charles-danbri-amaya-outline.jpg"
        alt="charles and danbri, outlined" align="right"
        width="145" height="102" />
      </p>
      <p>
        We want to expand this experiment to explore the use of RDF
        and other W3C technology for better image description. One
        idea is to use W3C's SVG image format to pick out the
        different regions of the image, and annotate them with RDF
        to say what they depict. W3C's Amaya browser <a
        href="http://www.w3.org/2001/08/rdfweb/svg-foaf.html">can
        generate these SVG outlines</a>, which provide us the basis
        for annotating regions of an image. We can use RDF to say
        things like 'this bit depicts the person whose email
        address is charles@w3.org; ...'. We've not worked out the
        exact details of the RDF vocabulary and data format yet,
        but it looks promising. (<a

        info...</a>).
