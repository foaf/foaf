<p>This document is intended to provide an illustrated walkthrough of the RDFWeb 
distributed photo-metadata experiment. Right now it is pretty bare, but
hopefully will give you an idea of what we're attempting.
</p>

online demo</a></p>

<p>
RDFWeb is intended to be both fun and technically challenging. We are trying to 
make at least some of the writing here accessible for a general audience,
although much of it will be for the rather small community familiar with the 
subtleties of various Semantic Web technologies. So we're trying to build a
linked information system, RDFWeb, as a way of connecting these two goals. In 
particular, we're trying to come up with practical and interesting applications
for the Semantic Web, and explore ways of making them real. One of our favourite 
examples is <em>photo metadata</em>. This document tries to explain why...
</p>

<p>
The (soon to be "Semantic") Web, if it is to reach its full
potential, needs to become a lot more <em>automatic</em>. We hope that it will be able to do
things (offer us <em>services</em>) based on combining data and services
scattered around the Web. It might, for example, be able to find the phone
numbers or AOL screen names of all your friends and professional collaborators.
Or show you the photos, names and recent publications and shared bookmarks for 
everyone attending the next meeting in your calendar. 
</p>
<p>
There are so many things the 
Web <em>might</em> usefully do in the future, that it is sometimes hard to see how we 
might get there from here. W3C's RDF has been around since 1997, yet while it 
has been adopted in a number of applications (eg. Mozilla, Open Directory, Adobe, RSS 1.0), people often ask why there is as yet no <em>killer app</em> for RDF. While 
we're not sure that 'killer app' is the right way to think about the problem, it 
is true that there is relatively little RDF data 'out there in the public Web',
 in the way that HTML is 'out there'.
</p>

<p>
The original idea behind RDFWeb was to experiment with making some cheap, simple 
RDF document formats that were designed for deployment in the public Web. We 
began by asking 'What would it be like if machines could read my homepage?', and 
by prototyping a simple vocabulary called FOAF ('Friend of a Friend').

<p>
Here's an example path through photos from me to Frank Sinatra. Some of 
these photos are described in RDFWeb already, others I just found using 
<a href="http://images.google.com/">Google image search</a>.
