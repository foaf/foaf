<h2>RDFWeb Overview</h2>

<p>
RDFWeb is a toolset and site which enable you to link pieces of 
information together and discover connections between them. The
implementations on this site focus on people, their creations, 
their collaborators and the people they know. 
<br />

The <a href="2000/08/why/">general overview</a> provides more
detailed explanation, and includes a <a

<h3>Nutshell description</h3>

<p>
RDFWeb is an experimental linked information system, where the linked
items are machine-understandable documents in the World Wide Web. These
documents, written in the XML, RDF and XHTML languages, are harvested by
our 'scutter' indexers, which then merge the resulting information to form
one big database. By exploiting various features of the RDF technology
alongside related tools such as digital signature, we can
use the Web to retrieve structured information that machines can process
and act upon. RDFWeb is best understood as
an exploration of the question: "<em>what would it be like if machines
could read what we say in our Web homepages</em>".
