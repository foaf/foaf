    <h2>
      RDFWeb Overview
    </h2>
    <p>
      RDFWeb is a toolset and site which enable you to link pieces
      of information together and discover connections between
      them. The implementations on this site focus on people, their
      creations, their collaborators and the people they
      know.<br />
      <br />
       The (woefully incomplete) <a href="2000/08/why/">general
      overview</a> provides more detailed explanation of what we're
      trying to do.
    </p>
    <h3>
      Nutshell description
    </h3>
    <blockquote>
      RDFWeb is an experimental linked information system, where
      the linked items are machine-understandable documents in the
      World Wide Web. These documents, written in the XML, RDF and
      XHTML languages, are harvested by our 'scutter' indexers,
      which then merge the resulting information to form one big
      database. By exploiting various features of the RDF
      technology alongside related tools such as digital signature,
      we can use the Web to retrieve structured information that
      machines can process and act upon. RDFWeb is best understood
      as an exploration of the question: "<em>what would it be like
      if machines could read what we say in our Web
      homepages</em>".

    <h3>
      RDFWeb Vocabulary
    </h3>
    <p>
      The initial RDF/XML vocabulary that underpins RDFWeb is
      called FOAF ("Friend of a Friend"). It is used alongside
      other vocabularies (RDFCore, Dublin Core, Wordnet, RSS 1.0)
      to provide mixed-vocabulary descriptions of people,
      organisations, web services and other information resources.

    </ul>
    <h3>
      RDFWeb Services
    </h3>
    <p>
      RDFWeb is constructed from a number of services. The basic
      building blocks are RDF and XML parsers, and XSLT
      transformations: this technology is available "off the
      shelf". RDFWeb provides authors of such software with a
      large, distributed and heterogeneous collection of test files
      to help them refine their software. In addition to parsers,
      RDFWeb agggregation points require some sort of RDF database
      support. Again, these aren't a core part of RDFWeb itself,
      the idea is to use RDFWeb to help us develop and test such
      tools. The most visible component of RDFWeb is the Web-based
      user interface that presents the aggregated data back to
      users. We have had a Perl and a Java implementation,
      currently only the latter is maintained.

    <h3>
      Security, trust...
    </h3>
    <p>
      RDFWeb raises some interesting issues relating to trust and
      provenance. We have created a simple RDF vocabulary, <a
      href="http://xmlns.com/wot/0.1/">WOT</a> ("web-o-trust") to
      test some ideas about the combination of digital signatures
      with RDF content. Currently, some RDF files in the RDFWeb
      have been signed using GPG or PGP; those files typically
      contain a pointer to the result of that signing, and may also
      contain or point to information about the signer, and claims
      about reciprocal key-signing events. The intent here is to
      provide enough meta-information to support a variety of trust
      and provenance strategies.
