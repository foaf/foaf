      RDFWeb notebook: aggregation strategies
    </h1>
    <p>
      This document (eventually...) outlines a strategy for
      handling anonymous resource description with RDF datastores.
      We introduce the problem by way of a practical example and
      then explore the implications for deployable RDF systems. The
      accompanying <a href="examples.rdf">examples.rdf</a> file
      might be useful for RDF implementors to experiment with.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Implementations
    </h2>
    <p>
      See the <a
      href="http://ilrt.org/discovery/chatlogs/rdfig/2001-07-20.html#T15-26-36">
      RDF Interest Group logs</a> for details on Dan Connolly's
      implementation using <a
      href="http://www.w3.org/2000/10/swap/">cwm</a> and N3 rules.
      To run, you'll need <a href="#various">various files</a> from
      the CWM/SWAP site, and an installation of Python. Usage:
      <code>python cwm.py --rdf smush-examples.rdf --n3
      smush-schema.n3 sameThing.n3 --think --apply=forgetDups.n3
      --purge</code> The resulting <a href="cwm-output.n3">N3
      output</a> from CWM shows a dump of everything it concludes
      from this input.

    <h2>
      Problem statement
    </h2>
    <p>
      RDF descriptions typically mention a number of resources
      without providing their URI names. Representations of these
      "mentioned but not named" resources are sometimes called
      "anonymous nodes" or "anonymous resources". This can be
      somewhat misleading, in that the resource identified by such
      a node in an RDF graph is not in itself anonymous; rather it
      is the mention of that resource in some chunk of data that is
      nameless. An RDF description that anonymously mentions a
      resource, such as some Person, Organisation, Document etc.,
      presents a challenge for RDF database systems.
    </p>
    <p>
      RDF uses Web identifiers (URI names) to facilitate data
      aggregation, ie. merging RDF graphs from multiple sources by
      joining on common URIs. When URIs are scarse, other
      strategies are needed. This document describes some
      approaches that might be used, and their relationship to RDF
      storage and query APIs.

    <p>
      These three example pieces of RDF tell us a little about some
      fictional company, its owner, and an ethical policy that
      companies such as this can claim to abide to. It should be
      noted that statements such as those made in these examples
      could be made by various agents in various contexts, and that
      many RDF database systems will need to track such
      information. For example, the claim in c.rdf that the company
      whose corporateHomepage is http://megacorp.example.com/
      abides by the ethical policy at
      http://dotherightthing.example.org/policy.xhtml could be made
      by some trusted third party, or else by the person whose
      personal mailbox is mailto:mega@megacorp.example.com.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having noted the importance of storing context and provenance
      information when aggregating heterogeneous RDF data, the
      remainder of this note will (for simplicity sake) avoid such
      complications. We assume that our database will have some
      characterisation of the source of each RDF message or
      datasource that we are concerned with. [ more needed here ]
    </p>
    <p>
      Our example scenario, setting aside provenance and trust
      issues, is pretty simple. We have three chunks of RDF/XML
      data, each providing fragments of information that can
      usefully be combined. Our goal is to combine this information
      successfully despite the lack of common URIs for the key
      entities described in the three RDF files. Whether we do this
      at storage time, at query time, or some combination of both
      remains to be discussed.
    </p>
    <p>
      In an ideal (or perhaps rather Orwellian) world, Persons
      would have URI names (eg: person:nx:930366b), as would
      Organisations, intellectual works and the countless other
      types of thing that RDF treats as 'resources'. In the real
      world, by contrast, People aren't considered to have URI
      names in the same way that Web pages, mailboxes etc have.
      Even if they did, we still have the problem that any given
      piece of RDF might mention a resource "in passing" without
      bothering to mention the URI name for that resource. Since
      URIs aren't always available or supplied, we need to explore
      alternative strategies for identifying resources.
    </p>
    <p>
      Only through accurate identification, ie. knowing when two
      descriptions refer to the self-same thing) can we
      successfully aggregate RDF/XML data. There are many ways in
      which a processor (RDF database, query engine etc) might
      determine resource identity. In the simplest case, having the
      same URI name is all we need to know. In complex cases,
      sophisticated rules, heuristics and other policies (eg.
      relating to trust, and information quality or timeliness)
      come into play. This document attempts to characterise some
      simple strategies. There is (and can be) no general purpose
      algorithm for the "complete" merging of disparate data;
      instead, we explore a sliding scale which begins with common
      URIs and shades off into the blueskies complexity of AI
      research.
    </p>
    <p>
      RDF datastores need some common baseline techniques that can
      deployed with moderate effort; these need not attempt a
      perfect solution to the data aggregation problem, but they
      will need to go some way towards usefully handing data that
      (a) describes things without naming them and (b) describes
      things that lack URI names.
    </p>
    <h3>
      Example queries:
    </h3>
    <p>
      To recap, our three RDF files describe a company 'megacorp',
      its owner, some person called 'mr mega', and its corporate
      ethical policy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let's assume we have an interest in aggregating the
      statements encoded in these three pieces of RDF/XML, so that
      we can answer questions such as the following:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      (Q1) What are the technology interests of persons who own
      companies that have an ethical policy committment to the
      policy stated in the document
      http://dotherightthing.example.org/policy.xhtml
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      To answer such a question in the absence of URI names for the
      company and person, we need to identify them using other
      information that we have about those entities. In this
      scenario, we exploit additional meta-information about some
      of the properties used in our descriptions. Specifically, we
      make assume that... personalMailbox, personalHomepage and
      corporateHomepage are uniquely identifying properties. By
      this we mean that, for any given value of one of these
      properties, there exists 'at most one' resource with that
      characteristic.
    </p>
    <p>
      We do not concern ourselves here with
      &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; we know this, except to note that
      augmented RDF schemas might be used to represent such
      interesting properties-of-properties. A similar principle
      might extend to clusters of properties (eg.
      nationalInsuranceNumber plus countryCode), just as relational
      database systems allow combinations of fields to serve as a
      unique key. For now, we explore only the simplest case of
      single uniquely identifying properties.
    </p>
    <p>
      Addressing our query (Q1), we can focus on the subset of the
      three data files that provide relevant information. At this
      stage we need to go beyond the XML encoding of the RDF. RDF
      parsers typically generate random pseudo URI identifiers
      (genid:42423432 etc) as stand-in identifiers for anonymously
      mentioned resources. As we translate our XML examples into
      the triples of the RDF data model, we will need a similar
      convention for representing resources whose URI we don't
      know. Any convention will do so long as there is no risk of
      name clash, and no risk of confusing these generated stand-in
      identifiers for 'real' URIs extracted from the RDF/XML
      markup. The convention we use here is to use strings of the
      form 'var:&lt;some-unique-number&gt;' as placeholder
      identifiers, eg. var:452373522380604496.
    </p>

      unique.

    <h3>
      Interpretation
    </h3>
    <p>
      Without knowing about the uniquely identifying nature of the
      personalMailbox, personalHomepage and corporateHomepage
      properties, we can interpret T1-T3 as follows:
    </p>
    <p>
      [T1] There exists a company that has a corporate homepage is
      http://megacorp.example.com/ ; it has an owner is a Person
      that has a personal mailbox at
      mailto:mega@megacorp.example.com
    </p>
    <p>
      [T2] There exists a resource that has a personal mailbox
      mailto:mega@megacorp.example.com and that has technology
      interests characterised by three URIs
      (http://www.w3.org/XML/, http://www.w3.org/RDF/,
      http://www.mozilla.org/).
    </p>
    <p>
      [T3] There exists an organisation with a corporate home page
      of http://megacorp.example.com/ and that has an ethicalPolicy
      that is a PolicyStatement,
      http://dotherightthing.example.org/policy.xhtml.
    </p>
    <h3>
      Revised Interpretation
    </h3>
    <p>
      Once we take into account meta-information to the effect that
      there can be at most one...
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        ...resource with any particular corporateHomepage
      </li>
      <li>
        ...resource with any particular personalHomepage
      </li>
      <li>
        ...resource with any particular personalMailbox
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Our natural language interpretation of these RDF triples can
      be made richer. Instead of saying "a Person with a personal
      mailbox of ..." we can say " *the* Person with a personal
      mailbox of ...", since we know that only one such resource
      should exist, by virtue of the meaning of 'personalMailbox'.
      Similarly for corporateHomepage.
    </p>
    <p>
      If this were not the case, two companies might have the same
      corporate homepage, or two persons the same personal mailbox.
      In which case we would need to find other strategies for
      aggregating our 3 data fragments.
    </p>
    <p>
      Exploiting this knowledge, we can be sure that the resource
      we called var:001 in a.rdf ("the company whose
      corporateHomepage is http://megacorp.example.com/ ") is one
      and the same thing as the resource we called var:101 in
      b.rdf. Similarly, our representation of a.rdf labels the
      person whose personal mailbox is
      mailto:mega@megacorp.example.com as var:002. We labelled the
      selfsame resource in b.rdf as var:100.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having realised this, we have enough information to answer
      Q1. In our imagined database, we might go through and replace
      every occurance of var:001 with var:101, so that we have a
      common (private) identifier for the company. Similarly, we
      could ensure that the person whose mailbox is
      mailto:mega@megacorp.example.com has a single identifier.
      Once this is done, the database would be in a state that
      would allow it to service queries such as Q1 without the
      query-processing engine, or the query itself, having to deal
      with these unique identification issues.
    </p>
    <p>
      A Squish [ref] RDF query for Q1 would be:
    </p>
<pre>
(SQ1)

 SELECT ?I 
 FROM default database
 WHERE ( rdf::type ?P Person ) 
       ( technologyInterest ?P ?I )
       ( owner ?P ?C )
       ( ethicalPolicy ?C http://dotherightthing.example.org/policy.xhtml )
 USING rdf for http://www.w3.org/.../rdf-syntax#
       default namespace http://example.rdfweb.org/smushtest.rdf#
</pre>
    <p>
      in english:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      What are the technology interests of persons who own
      companies that have an ethical policy committment to the
      policy stated in the document
      http://dotherightthing.example.org/policy.xhtml
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      Note that the above query assumes the database somehow takes
      care of the node convergence problems associated with
      anonymous resource mentions (ie. mapping var:002 and var:100
      to the same entity). Whether the database does this at query
      time or in advance is an implementation issue.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our problem now becomes one of putting all this into
      practice.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Section 2: Precomputing resource identity
    </h2>
    <p>
      Here we describe a strategy for precomputing identifiers for
      anonymously mentioned resources.
    </p>
    <h3>
      Overview
    </h3>
    <p>
      Assume an RDF database system that can store triples and
      present them for query via a simple API. Many RDF API
      proposals offer a facility such as 'triplesMatching' that is
      passed a partial representation of an RDF triple, and returns
      matching triples from the database. A 'rename' operation is
      not common, however, so we will deal with renaming externally
      to the database, by maintaining a table that maps private
      (generated IDs) to public URIs, where these are known, as
      well as equivalencies amongst our private identifiers. Our
      database will be managed through a bottleneck that attempts
      to minimise needless fragmentation of the aggregate data
      graph. To achieve this, whenever we set about adding a set of
      RDF assertions to our store, we will rewrite any generated
      IDs supplied by the RDF parser to take account of our
      existing (private) identifiers for those entities (if any).
      Similarly, if the local database already knows the public URI
      for that resource, we'll use that instead when adding the new
      triples.
    </p>
    <p>
      For example, we may have already parsed and stored triples
      from a.rdf. When we later acquire b.rdf and want to add
      additional triples describing the person whose mailbox is
      mailto:mega@megacorp.example.com, we should take account of
      our existing private identifier for that person. We know that
      there can be at most one person with that identifier, so we
      may as well pick a common generated identifier for him/her to
      save on subsequent processing load. That person might also be
      identified through other strategies (the person whose
      aolScreenName is..., the person whose humanGenomeChecksum is
      ... etc). Sometimes we will add information to the database
      without, at that point in time, adequate information (in the
      database or in the incoming rdf file) to be sure we're
      talking about a common entity [ref hofstadter paper -
      Shakespeare etc]. This is where simple RDF graph merging
      shades into more complex areas of research facing the AI
      community, i.e. the 'belief update' problem faced by symbolic
      representational systems. When we acquire a new belief, which
      of our prior beliefs need updating, what new inferences can
      we draw?
    </p>
    <p>
      Back in perlhacker land, here's the problem...
    </p>
    <p>
      We're loading RDF files into a database, and want to know
      what to do, if anything, between getting triples from a
      parser and stashing them (somehow) on disk.
    </p>
    <p>
      We could acquire and store a.rdf, b.rdf and c.rdf in any
      order, ie:
    </p>
<pre>
   a b c (a.rdf then b.rdf then c.rdf...)
    a c b
    b a c
    b c a 
    c a b
    c b a
</pre>
    <p>
      Each of these scenarios puts our RDF data management policy
      to a different test. A more realistic scenario, with 1000s of
      transactions concerning 1000s of inter-related entities,
      sometimes URI named, sometimes not, is our real goal and will
      be our real test.
    </p>
    <p>
      Assume we meet our example files in the order 'a b c', and
      add them to the database in that order. We assume a parser
      supplies representations such as T1, T2, T3, ie. generates
      private identifiers that we may or may not decide to carry
      over into our actual database. After 'a', we have in our
      hands an intermediate representation of the triples of a, in
      which var:001 is a stand-in for the URI of the company and
      var:002 for the Person that owns it. Generally, we would use
      various heuristics (sketched below) cbefore adding the data
      to our store; since examples have to start somewhere we'll
      assume the triples from a.rdf get added as-is, ie. we're
      starting with a blank database.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now we meet b.rdf, and generate (using some RDF parser) an
      intermediate representation which employs a new stand-in
      identifier for that person. Recall that our database now
      contains the triples [T1], alongside knowledge (hardcoded or
      acquired in RDF) about various uniquely identifying
      properties. a.rdf introduced us to both the person and the
      company, and gave us uniquely identifying information about
      them (the corporate home page of the former; the personal
      mailbox of the latter). So now we examine our representation
      of b.rdf, which happens to tell us some more (non uniquely
      identifying) properties of the person resource. We need to
      consider, for each incoming generated identifier (in this
      case just "var:100") whether we might already have a better
      name for the resource it names. Maybe we know its URI. Maybe
      we've already adopted a private generated ID for it. We
      consequently need to work out what queries to ask our
      existing database concerning the entities mentioned (but not
      named) in the incoming datafile.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this case, we're wondering about the resource temporarily
      referred to as 'var:100'. We look to the incoming data for
      uniquely identifying information. The following triple is
      relavent (since personalMailbox is uniquely identifying):
    </p>
    <p>
      ( personalMailbox, var:100, mailto:mega@megacorp.example.com
      )
    </p>
    <p>
      So we know have a non-URI way of picking out the entity we're
      concerned with. In a more complex example, the incoming data
      might offer two or more strategies for identifying an
      individual. In a very complex example, the incoming data
      combined with our existing local database might offer several
      identifying descriptions. With this (the simple case) in mind
      we consult our database, asking (in Perl RDF...):
    </p>
    <p>
      @triples = $mydb-&gt;find(personalMailbox, undef,
      mailto:mega@megacorp.example.com )
    </p>
    <p>
      This would do the trick. We'd get back any statements in our
      database where the predicate was 'personalMailbox', the
      subject was left unconstrained, and the object was that
      mailbox. If we assume for now that the database contains only
      trusted and accurate data, we should find only a single value
      that plays the subject role in this template statement.
    </p>
    <p>
      If we get no value back from the query, we've got no name yet
      for the resource with that mailbox, so we may as well use
      var:100. If we get an answer (which in our current scenario
      will be var:002) then we'll use var:002 in preference for
      var:100 when we get around to asserting the new (rewritten)
      triples into the store. We should also remember than b.rdf
      might well have made multiple separate mentions of that
      resource.
    </p>
    <p>
      [TODO: we have a problem here if b.rdf were to have mentioned
      that resource and supplied its URI; for such scenarios, it
      might work to do our lookup against the hypothetical
      aggregate of b.rdf and the main database].
    </p>
    <p>
      Note: We shouldn't add any triples to the database until
      we've investigated all the generated identifiers associated
      with our representation of b.rdf, (partly) since the triples
      we get back from a parser will be in no particular order.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pseudo code:
    </p>
<pre>
my $tmp = new AggregateDS();
$tmp.addDS($incoming);
$tmp.addDS($main);

foreeach $genid ( $incoming-&gt;genids ) { 
   push ( $tmpmap{$genid} , betternames($tmp,$genid) );
}
</pre>
    <p>
      We now have a table of better names for each generated ID in
      the incoming data. Having this, we can loop through the
      triples in b.rdf, and if we find a generated resource
      identifier (whether in predicate, subject or object roles)
      replace it with our better identifier. It might be another
      generated ID, or it might be a real URI.
    </p>
    <p>
      Learning a URI later
    </p>
    <p>
      What happens if we subsequently find out the 'real' URI for a
      resource we initially identify with a generated ID? Maybe our
      database has an operation allowing us to for example switch
      'var:100' wherever it to occurs to (say)
      'person:us:ni-3422000023'. That would be OK. If not, we could
      use some wrapper for the database that knew how to answer
      queries as if we'd make such a replacement.
