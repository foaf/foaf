    <title>FOAF fun had by all</title>
    <description>15 August 2002: Recent news roundup: FOAF people have hanging out on irc:irc.openprojects.net#foaf. Edd Dumbill has written an interesting article about his foaf experiments for IBM developerWorks XML Watch: Finding friends with XML and RDF and has been doing very interesting things with his foafbot. Eikeon has written an foaf browser. Libby released Inkling again with refactoring by Libby and Leigh Dodds, and testcases. JibberJim has continued making neat SVG demos and tools. Leigh Dodds has created a javascript foaf-a-matic for creating foaf data easily. Dan's been playing with FOAFCorp, TAP and anti-spam whitelists again, as well as improving RubyRDF to better support Scutter, a new RDFWeb aggregator. The FOAF namespace document has also been updated, and FOAF homepage created. Thanks to Edd's writeup and foafbot implementation, there are now quite a few PGP-signed FOAF documents in the Web, as well as some experiments with encryption. For other FOAF mentions, see the news snippets page.</description>

    <title>RDFWeb.org revamp, finally</title>
    <description>09 February 2002: The RDFWeb site has finally been updated. The new site remains loyal to the old vapourware theme, promising more than it delivers, lurching from incomplete high level overviews to obscure technical detail without providing much in the middle. The tentative sitemap draws together some previously scattered pointers to RDFWeb-related documents, and highlights a new focus on the ambitiously silly FOAF co-depiction experiment. Will a co-depiction craze sweep the Web? Only after someone writes the HOWTO... (news archive)</description>

    <title>WWW2002 paper rejected</title>
    <description>26 January 2002: Plans for flaunting RDFWeb vapourware at the WWW2002 Web conference suffered a minor setback this week, when peer reviewers rejected as 'brain-dumpy' a paper describing some RDFWeb-inspired organisational modelling work at ILRT. We'll probably be there anyway due to other commitments so who cares... :) (news archive)</description>

    <title>RDFWeb site redesign</title>
    <description>26 January 2002: At long last, the RDFWeb site redesign has been postponed again. The new design fails to replace the crufty scribbles currently served by rdfweb.org. Failing to exploit CSS1, XSLT and other new fangled technologies in any interesting way, the undeployed redesign does at least have fewer words on the home page. (news archive)</description>
