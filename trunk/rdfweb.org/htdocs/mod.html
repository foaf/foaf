RDFWeb: Modesty!

<h2>Modesty...</h2>

<p>Modesty? An odd thing to prioritise on a tech website... RDFWeb is all
about modesty. Or more accurately, about finding a delicate balance
between modesty, sarcasm and wide-eyed idealism. 
</p>
<p>
RDFWeb was created as an escape route from some of the pomposity that
surrounds technology such as XML, and as an exercise in
'build it and see'. Some of this will become clear
as the system comes together. In the meantime it would be immodest to
continue this rant...
