    <h1>botmute article</h1>

    <p>This page is a wrapper for attempts to SVG-ize (and/or
    HTML-ize) the article that several of us wrote for Mute
    magazine last year... Current contents are just Dean's first
    attempt at converting it from Illustrator to SVG; the fonts
    aren't quite right yet. He also kindly offered to make a 4-page
    version. An HTML rendering would also be useful...</p>
