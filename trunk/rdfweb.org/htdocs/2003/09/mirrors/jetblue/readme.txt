US lawyers are trying to remove this document from the internet, It has disappeared 
from its original location (a software conference) because it reveals that an US 
government contractor got 5 million passenger flight records from JetBlue with help 
from TSA, matched them up with a commercial data-mining database, and tried to 
prototype the "CAPPS 2" terrorist profiling system with them.

Until today both JetBlue and TSA denied this, but this is the smoking gun.

This document has been mirrored so that the information about the abuse of 
data-mining by the US government and its contractors will be available to assist the 
people in Europe who are fighting the US regime who want every flight record from 
every European flight.
