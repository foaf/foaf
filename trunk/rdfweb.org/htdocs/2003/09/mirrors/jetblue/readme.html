<blockquote>US lawyers are trying to remove this document from the
internet, It has disappeared from its original location (a software
conference) because it reveals that an US government contractor got
5 million passenger flight records from JetBlue with help from TSA,
matched them up with a commercial data-mining database, and tried
to prototype the "CAPPS 2" terrorist profiling system with them.
Until today both JetBlue and TSA denied this, but this is the
smoking gun. This document has been mirrored so that the
information about the abuse of data-mining by the US government and
its contractors will be available to assist the people in Europe
who are fighting the US regime who want every flight record from
every European flight.</blockquote>
