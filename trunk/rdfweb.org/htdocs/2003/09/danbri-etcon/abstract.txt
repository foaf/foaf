  "Fear of a FOAF Planet - Acronyms and activism on the Semantic Web"

The Friend of a Friend (FOAF) project is creating a Web of machine-readable 
homepages describing people, the links between them and the things they create and  
do. This session introduces the FOAF project, giving a lightning tour of its 
origins, goals, current status and possible futures. 

What would happen (to privacy, to the media, to commerce) if search engines evolved 
into aggregating databases? What would happen if machines could exchange, 
merge and reason about descriptions of people using standards-based, freely 
available tools? What should we do as these 'ifs' become 'whens'?

FOAF has many possible futures: utopian, dystopian, and the spaces in between. 
This session will outline FOAF's approach to application development, illustrated 
with scenarios currently under development - eg FOAFMobile tools ("show me weblogs 
by people sitting nearby"), interactions between social networking, activism and 
indy media ("I'd like to talk to a FOAF who has been to Iraq..."). 

Modest technologies can have unexpected consequences. As a simple technology 
designed to encourage coincidences, FOAF opens up many possibilities. 
Moving towards mainstream use, we must balance wide-eyed optimism 
with sober assessments of possible unwelcome futures. FOAF is both a driver for 
change, and a readily accessible tool for understanding, adapting to and 
participating in this changed world. While FOAF is in essence a tool 
for describing and modeling our world, the Semantic Web may be a tool for changing 
it.
