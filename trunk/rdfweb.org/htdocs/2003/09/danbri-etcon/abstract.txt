  "Fear of a FOAF Planet - Acronyms and activism on the Semantic Web"

The Friend of a Friend (FOAF) project is creating a Web of machine-readable 
homepages describing people, the links between them and the things they make and  
do. This session introduces FOAF, giving a lightning tour of its origins, goals, 
current status and possible futures. 

What would happen (to privacy, to the media, to commerce) if search engines evolved 
into structured, aggregating databases? What would happen if machines could 
exchange, merge and reason about descriptions of people using standards-based, freely 
available tools? What should we do as these 'ifs' become 'whens'?

This session will outline the basics of FOAF, illustrated with discussion of ongoing 
work including FOAFMobile ("show me weblogs and profiles for people sitting 
nearby"), FOAFCorp ("Reveal the hidden structure of contemporary capitalism! build 
a better corporate intranet!"), as well as the issues arising from the convergence 
of social networking, activism and indy media concerns ("I'd like to talk to a FOAF 
who has been to Iraq...").

FOAF has many possible futures: utopian, dystopian, and the spaces in between. 
Modest technologies can have unexpected consequences. As a simple technology 
designed to encourage coincidence, FOAF opens up many possibilities. 
Moving towards mainstream use, we must balance wide-eyed optimism 
with sober assessments of possible unwelcome futures. FOAF is both a driver for 
change, and a readily accessible tool for understanding, adapting to and 
participating in this changed world. While FOAF is at heart a tool for 
describing and modeling our world, the Semantic Web is a tool for changing it.
