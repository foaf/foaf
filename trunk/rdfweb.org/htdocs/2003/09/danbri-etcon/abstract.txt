  "Fear of a FOAF Planet - Acronyms and Antics on the Semantic Web"

The Friend of a Friend (FOAF) project is creating a Web of machine-readable 
homepages describing people, the links between them and the things they create and  
do. This session introduces the FOAF project, giving a lightning tour of its 
origins, goals, current status and possible futures. 

What would happen (to privacy, to the media, to commerce) if search engines evolved 
into aggregating databases? What would happen if machines could exchange, 
merge and reason about descriptions of people using standards-based, freely 
available tools? What should we do as these 'ifs' become 'whens'?

FOAF has many possible futures: utopian, dystopian, and the spaces in between. 
The overview will focus on real world FOAF applications currently in development,  
including FOAFMobile tools ("show me weblogs by people sat nearby") 
and interactions between social networking, activism and indy media ("I'd like to 
talk to a FOAF who has been to Iraq..."). FOAF's use of RDF technology guarantees a 
certain freedom of expression - FOAF documents can contain additional markup 
bringing more detail to to descriptions of people, places, events, relationships. 

Modest technologies can have unexpected consequences. As a simple technology 
designed to encourage coincidences, FOAF opens up many possibilities. 
Moving towards mainstream use, we must balance wide-eyed optimism 
with sober assessments of possible unwelcome futures. FOAF is both as a driver for 
change, and a readily accessible tool for understanding, adapting to and 
participating in this changed world. While FOAF is in essence a tool 
for describing and modeling the world, it is often hard to describe something 
without changing it.
