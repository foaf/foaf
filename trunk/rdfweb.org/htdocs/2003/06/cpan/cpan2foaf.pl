# A crude Perl script to emit RDF/XML FOAF description of CPAN contributors
# 
# Author: dan brickley <danbri@rdfweb.org>, <danbri@w3.org>
#
# This reads the 01mailrc.txt list of authors and their cpan IDs and 'real' mailboxes.
# It puts both through sha1sum so we don't create a spam harvesting goldmine and emits
# a very basic RDF description on STDOUT.
#
# When RDF-merged with other data sources, this should provide fodder for queries such 
# as "Find me weblog posts by CPAN contributors". 
# For example, a match of:
#
# (foaf:weblog ?x ?y)
# (dc:contributor ?x http://www.cpan.org/)
# (foaf:name ?x ?z)
#
# ...using Squish RDF query syntax here would return us a table of ?x, ?y, ?z 
# results where ?y and ?z were the weblog URI and name of contributors to CPAN.
# 
# Note that our dataset here is inadequate to service this query, it solely provides
# information about who contributes, and a couple of their mailboxes. Assuming the 
# contributor had a FOAF description that mentioned (a) one of his/her mailboxes as 
# listed in CPAN authors file (b) their name and weblog, we'd have enough info.
# For the query to match, we'd need an RDF harvester that loaded up all the relevant 
# data, and that 'smushed' it together, ideally after computing the extra 
# mbox_sha1sum properties in case they weren't mentioned explicitly in the src data.

# <danbri> ah alias ZUMMO is the last person, then there is a bunch of groups

# TODO: 
# - fix documentation to be perldoc friendly
# - load mailrc.txt from cpan if not held locally
# - derrive collaboration graph as foaf:knows for http://www.foafnaut.org/ visualisation
