/**
 *
 * This class is intended to augment JFCs 'ActionListener' model,
 * which I find amazingly annoying compared with Cocoa/NeXT's
 * Target/Selector model. Many things (like menu code) becomes
 * horribly verbose - but maybe I'm not doing it right.
 *
 * Anyway, this class implements ActionListener and takes a target (an
 * object to which the message is sent) and a selector (a method).
