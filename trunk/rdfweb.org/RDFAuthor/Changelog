    Ok - finally GPLd it. Hurrah. Also included Jena and Axis licences.
    
    Command + Double-click on a resource node (not anonymous) opens the URL. Dan
    wanted this ;-)
    
    Switched build to copy (rather than merge) libs. Quicker.

    Queries might be less buggy :-). I don't do thread.stop() anymore - it just keeps
    going (unless garbage collecting gets it?). Anyway, not perfect.
    
    Bookmarking done. Icons suck, tho'
    
    Reduced icon sizes in toolbar - some issues (they look funny), but tidier.
    
    Added document sizing and fixed printing pagination (simple, ultimately). Document
    sizing needs to scale pic. You could get 'lost' model items.
    
    Document sizing also led to (slight) revision of info controller.

    Queries classes are buggy - I'll fix 'em later. Thread.stop() is a _bad_ thing and
    may be causing many problems. Also ResultSource needs to keep a copy of the mappings.
    
    Martin's bookmark idea is pretty neat - preliminary implementation done. Works, but
    is ugly.

    Queries now threaded. This is because they can take too long to hold up users. (By
    contrast Schema Imports are pretty nippy).
    
    Messed up file compatibility - hopefully this works with the last released version.

    Added the new query stuff. This is pretty nice, with a spiffy interface. The 'adding
    queries' bit has some issues, though.
    
    Slimmed jena libs a bit - didn't need rdffilter. But query adds more (SOAP related)
    clutter.
    
    ArcNodeList inner workings are better exposed to the world now - I should be able to
    move some clutter out of the model classes and into better positions.
    
    Error panels overhauled.

    Bunch of new things. Some classes have been updated to remove old java stuff (Vector,
    Hashtable) with their spiffy new counterparts.
    
    Schema related classes have been overhauled to be - hey! - almost readable.
    
    Schema now allows deleting of elements (though there is an odd bug when Classes or Properties
    becomes empty, then new stuff is added).
    
    When adding nodes or arcs (whichever is relevant) the currently selected schema type is used.
    Eg if 'foaf::person' is selected then new nodes are of type 'foaf::person'. This was Libby's
    idea - makes adding arcs more convienient.
    
    Preliminary work on query added.

    Fixed revert non-displaying.
    
    Fixed save/load problem. I'll handle versioning now, thank you java :-)
    
    That last bit also frees me up to do some nice stuff like RDF import. Watch this space...

    Erm - added a changelog ;-)
    
    Bunch of stuff, really. Added N-Triple and N3 export and preview - however N3 doesn't seem
    to exist in jena yet (?).
    
    Fixed toolbar idiocy.
    
    Stopped doing URL checks on Ids. Anything goes now.
    
    Info box is horizontally resizable. Shame I can't make it full resizable, but it tends to
    go nasty (items cover other items).
    
    Info entries (which haven't been added) don't disappear when you go to another window.
    
    Backspace now deletes current object. Hurrah!
