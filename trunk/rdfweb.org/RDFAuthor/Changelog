    Added a little text search box (like that cute one in iTunes).
    Added because I couldn't find 'seeAlso'.

2002/03/27 12:45:50 - pldms

    Changed the query process to solve random crash problem. Works
    so far...

2002/03/27 10:09:34 - pldms

    Added ability to open doc from URL.
    
    (Related) Open node URI now opens a new document if the node is an
    object of an rdfs:seeAlso (and hence ought to contain rdf).

    Rationalised structure - all graphics are stored in the rdfModelView.
    (GraphicalModel is gone).
    
    Improved speed by only calculating the arcs (arrow etc) when needed.
    
    Thwarted above by making changes to limiting arrowhead overlap on nodes.
    (Note: SVG needs to be changed to mirror this)

2002/02/19 13:51:20 - pldms
    
    Fixed bug loading old documents with empty selection.

2002/02/07 16:09:56 - pldms
    
    All toolbar functions have menu equivalents - so they are now accessable
    via keyboard shortcuts.

2002/02/06 17:28:53 - pldms
    
    Namespace prefixes fixed (i.e. works).
    
    Stationery support added. This, I might add, was annoying (though not
    difficult) because Cocoa doesn't use the Mac OS stationery flag. So
    (as recommened by Apple) there is a new filetype - RDFT - which is identical
    to RDFA but removes filename and fixes type to RDFA when loaded.

    Think I've fixed bookmarks so that they will serialise in a nice way
    (no Cocoa-specific stuff).

2002/02/05 16:02:57 - pldms

    Literals are now rectangles.
    
    Literal info field is now an NSTextView - this can handle /n and long strings.
    
    ID display is truncated if string > 40 chars. This is very useful for literals
    which can get very long. (You can still see the full thing in info).
    
    Info window is now tabbed - one for the selected item, one for the document.

2002/01/17 18:33:40 - pldms

    Schema list is now loaded from a file (Schemas), which also has prefixes.
    Alas prefixes aren't working - bah :-( - might have to use less efficient
    method.

2002/01/06 22:15:28 - pldms

    Woah. Big changes.
    
    Auto-layout much improved - speed and results are better.
    
    Multiple selections.
    
    Cut and Paste.
    
    Save bookmarks.
    
    Used Xerces to check URIs validity.

2001/12/11 22:38:01 - pldms

    Redrawing is much faster now. I've also extracted the graphics code from the model.
    This will make the swing port nicer. The relevant classes start are GraphicalXXX.
    
    Importing of rdf/xml implemented. This was pretty easy, but the autolayout was a bit
    harder (actually it only took an couple of hours, but I dragged my heels ;-).
    
    Saves image size - but can open v0.1 files.
    
    SVG export done. Looks pretty good. TIFF export also available.

2001/11/23 19:10:23 - pldms

    Ok - finally GPLd it. Hurrah. Also included Jena and Axis licences.
    
    Command + Double-click on a resource node (not anonymous) opens the URL. Dan
    wanted this ;-)
    
    Switched build to copy (rather than merge) libs. Quicker.

2001/11/20 02:21:06 - pldms
    
    Queries might be less buggy :-). I don't do thread.stop() anymore - it just keeps
    going (unless garbage collecting gets it?). Anyway, not perfect.
    
    Bookmarking done. Icons suck, tho'
    
    Reduced icon sizes in toolbar - some issues (they look funny), but tidier.
    
    Added document sizing and fixed printing pagination (simple, ultimately). Document
    sizing needs to scale pic. You could get 'lost' model items.
    
    Document sizing also led to (slight) revision of info controller.

2001/11/13 23:27:16 - pldms
    
    Queries classes are buggy - I'll fix 'em later. Thread.stop() is a _bad_ thing and
    may be causing many problems. Also ResultSource needs to keep a copy of the mappings.
    
    Martin's bookmark idea is pretty neat - preliminary implementation done. Works, but
    is ugly.

2001/11/08 16:12:48 - pldms
    
    Queries now threaded. This is because they can take too long to hold up users. (By
    contrast Schema Imports are pretty nippy).
    
    Messed up file compatibility - hopefully this works with the last released version.

2001/11/07 20:03:53 - pldms

    Added the new query stuff. This is pretty nice, with a spiffy interface. The 'adding
    queries' bit has some issues, though.
    
    Slimmed jena libs a bit - didn't need rdffilter. But query adds more (SOAP related)
    clutter.
    
    ArcNodeList inner workings are better exposed to the world now - I should be able to
    move some clutter out of the model classes and into better positions.
    
    Error panels overhauled.

2001/11/05 19:55:41 - pldms

    Bunch of new things. Some classes have been updated to remove old java stuff (Vector,
    Hashtable) with their spiffy new counterparts.
    
    Schema related classes have been overhauled to be - hey! - almost readable.
    
    Schema now allows deleting of elements (though there is an odd bug when Classes or Properties
    becomes empty, then new stuff is added).
    
    When adding nodes or arcs (whichever is relevant) the currently selected schema type is used.
    Eg if 'foaf::person' is selected then new nodes are of type 'foaf::person'. This was Libby's
    idea - makes adding arcs more convienient.
    
    Preliminary work on query added.

2001/11/02 18:18:04 - pldms
    
    Fixed revert non-displaying.
    
    Fixed save/load problem. I'll handle versioning now, thank you java :-)
    
    That last bit also frees me up to do some nice stuff like RDF import. Watch this space...

2001/10/26 14:21:11 - pldms
    
    Erm - added a changelog ;-)
    
    Bunch of stuff, really. Added N-Triple and N3 export and preview - however N3 doesn't seem
    to exist in jena yet (?).
    
    Fixed toolbar idiocy.
    
    Stopped doing URL checks on Ids. Anything goes now.
    
    Info box is horizontally resizable. Shame I can't make it full resizable, but it tends to
    go nasty (items cover other items).
    
    Info entries (which haven't been added) don't disappear when you go to another window.
    
    Backspace now deletes current object. Hurrah!
