    Fixed revert non-displaying.
    
    Fixed save/load problem. I'll handle versioning now, thank you java :-)
    
    That last bit also frees me up to do some nice stuff like RDF import. Watch this space...

    Erm - added a changelog ;-)
    
    Bunch of stuff, really. Added N-Triple and N3 export and preview - however N3 doesn't seem
    to exist in jena yet (?).
    
    Fixed toolbar idiocy.
    
    Stopped doing URL checks on Ids. Anything goes now.
    
    Info box is horizontally resizable. Shame I can't make it full resizable, but it tends to
    go nasty (items cover other items).
    
    Info entries (which haven't been added) don't disappear when you go to another window.
    
    Backspace now deletes current object. Hurrah!
