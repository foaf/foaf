    Bunch of new things. Some classes have been updated to remove old java stuff (Vector,
    Hashtable) with their spiffy new counterparts.
    
    Schema related classes have been overhauled to be - hey! - almost readable.
    
    Schema now allows deleting of elements (though there is an odd bug when Classes or Properties
    becomes empty, then new stuff is added).
    
    When adding nodes or arcs (whichever is relevant) the currently selected schema type is used.
    Eg if 'foaf::person' is selected then new nodes are of type 'foaf::person'. This was Libby's
    idea - makes adding arcs more convienient.
    
    Preliminary work on query added.

    Fixed revert non-displaying.
    
    Fixed save/load problem. I'll handle versioning now, thank you java :-)
    
    That last bit also frees me up to do some nice stuff like RDF import. Watch this space...

    Erm - added a changelog ;-)
    
    Bunch of stuff, really. Added N-Triple and N3 export and preview - however N3 doesn't seem
    to exist in jena yet (?).
    
    Fixed toolbar idiocy.
    
    Stopped doing URL checks on Ids. Anything goes now.
    
    Info box is horizontally resizable. Shame I can't make it full resizable, but it tends to
    go nasty (items cover other items).
    
    Info entries (which haven't been added) don't disappear when you go to another window.
    
    Backspace now deletes current object. Hurrah!
