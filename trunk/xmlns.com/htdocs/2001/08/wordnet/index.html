      RDFWeb: xmlns.com Wordnet Vocabulary
    </title>

    <h1>
      Wordnet for the Web
    </h1>
    <p>
      This page documents the <a href="/">xmlns.com</a> Wordnet
      vocabulary service, an RDF schema based on version 1.6 of the
      Wordnet lexical database.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Status
    </h2>
    <p>
      Our Wordnet service is experimental: please do not rely on
      what we have here for production grade work. We are serious
      about developing a mature version of xmlns Wordnet to
      underpin RDF vocabulary deployment, and caution that flaws in
      the current design may need fixing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Note that other RDF representations of Wordnet now exist; a
      comparison would be useful.
    </p>
    <h2>
      Details
    </h2>
    <p>
      The current service is based solely on the noun term
      hierarchy from Wordnet. The hypernym hierarchy (a ___ is a
      kind of ___) is projected into an RDF Schema 1.0 class
      hierarchy (the ___ class is an <code>rdfs:subClassOf</code>
      the class ___). This creates a rather large class hierarchy.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can address each noun from Wordnet using Web identifiers
      (URIs) of the form: <code>
      http://xmlns.com/wordnet/1.6/xxx</code> where 'xxx' is a word
      such as 'Cat', 'Tree', 'Person'. If you de-reference these
      URIs, the xmlns.com service provides an RDF description of
      that RDF class, plus detailed descriptions of immediate
      sub-classes and a list of the super-classes above it in the
      hierarchy.
    </p>
    <p>
      The word you use can optionally be qualified with a numeric
      suffix (eg '<a
      href="http://xmlns.com/wordnet/1.6/Dog">Dog</a>' vs ' <a
      href="http://xmlns.com/wordnet/1.6/Dog-2">Dog-2</a>')
      corresponding to the wordnet sense numbers associated with
      that word.
    </p>
    <h3>
      Deployment
    </h3>
    <p>
      You can import this vocabulary into RDF instance data, for
      example by writing <code>
      xmlns:wordnet="http://xmlns.com/wordnet/1.6/"</code>
    </p>
    <p>
      Having done this, you can use any noun from Wordnet as an RDF
      class (ie. type). Since RDF syntax provides a special
      convention for writing class names as XML elements, this can
      be rather useful.
    </p>
    <h3>
      Issues
    </h3>
    <p>
      In Wordnet, hypernym relations are between word-clusters
      ("synonym sets") not between the terms themselves. Typically
      a group of related words are organised together in wordnet as
      a synonym set (which will have some obscure numerical
      identifier, but does not correspond to any particular
      "dominant" or "representative" term from the synset, ie each
      term in a synset is equal). Consequently, when we create
      sub-class relations between RDF classes based on words in
      Wordnet, we ignore some of this structure. Our current
      implementation is based on real-time queries to the Wordnet
      tools, and will need re-engineering at the software and
      schema level to better improve this situation. For RDFWeb and
      xmlns.com, it is important to use real words ('Cat','Person'
      etc) as the class identifiers, so that RDF/XML written using
      this schema is readable and intuitive. We don't want numeric
      IDs instead, since this will create usability issues for
      deployment. A possible workaround is to have RDF classes both
      for each word in Wordnet (one per each member of the synset)
      and another RDF class for the synset itself. <em>More work
      needed...</em>

      One useful thing to do would be to make an <a
      href="http://www.rddl.org/">RDDL</a> description of the <a
      href="http://xmlns.com/wordnet/1.6/">Wordnet</a> namespace
      available.
