<p>
The <code>foaf:Group</code> class represents a collection of individual agents (and may 
itself play the role of a <code>foaf:Agent</code>, ie. something that can perform actions).
</p>
<p>
This concept is intentionally quite broad, covering informal and 
ad-hoc groups, long-lived communities, organizational groups within a workplace, etc. Some 
such groups may have associated characteristics which could be captured in RDF (perhaps a 
<code>foaf:homepage</code>, <code>foaf:name</code>, mailing list etc.).
</p>

<p>
While a <code>foaf:Group</code> has the characteristics of a <code>foaf:Agent</code>, it 
is also associated with a number of other <code>foaf:Agent</code>s (typically people) who 
constitute the <code>foaf:Group</code>. FOAF provides a mechanism, the 
<code>foaf:membershipClass</code> property, which relates a <code>foaf:Group</code> to a 
sub-class of the class <code>foaf:Agent</code> who are members of the group. This is a 
little complicated, but allows us to make group membership rules explicit.
</p>


<p>The markup (shown below) for defining a group is both complex and powerful. It 
allows group membership rules to match against any RDF-describable characteristics of the potential 
group members. As FOAF and similar vocabularies become more expressive in their ability to 
describe individuals, the <code>foaf:Group</code> mechanism for categorising them into 
groups also becomes more powerful. 
</p>

<p> 
While the formal description of membership criteria for a <code>foaf:Group</code> may
be complex, the basic mechanism for saying that someone is in a <code>foaf:Group</code> is
very simple. We simply use a <code>foaf:member</code> property of the
<code>foaf:Group</code> to indicate the agents that are members of the group. For example:

</p> 

<div class="example"> 

<pre> 
&lt;foaf:Group&gt;
 &lt;foaf:name&gt;ILRT staff&lt;/foaf:name&gt;
 &lt;foaf:member&gt;
  &lt;foaf:Person&gt;
   &lt;foaf:name&gt;Libby Miller&lt;/foaf:name&gt;
   &lt;foaf:homepage rdf:resource="http://ilrt.org/people/libby/"/&gt;
   &lt;foaf:workplaceHomepage rdf:resource="http://www.ilrt.bris.ac.uk/"/&gt;
  &lt;/foaf:Person&gt;
 &lt;/foaf:member&gt;
&lt;/foaf:Group&gt;
</pre>
</div>



<p>
Behind the scenes, further RDF statements can be used to express the rules for being a 
member of this group. End-users of FOAF need not pay attention to these details.
</p>


<p>
Here is an example. We define a <code>foaf:Group</code> representing those people who 
are ILRT staff members. The <code>foaf:membershipClass</code> property connects the group (conceived of as a social 
entity and agent in its own right) with the class definition for those people who 
constitute it. In this case, the rule is that all group members are in the 
ILRTStaffPerson class, which is in turn populated by all those things that are a 
<code>foaf:Person</code> and which have a <code>foaf:workplaceHomepage</code> of 
http://www.ilrt.bris.ac.uk/. This is typical: FOAF groups are created by 
specifying a sub-class of <code>foaf:Agent</code> (in fact usually this 
will be a sub-class of <code>foaf:Person</code>), and giving criteria 
for which things fall in or out of the sub-class. For this, we use the 
<code>owl:onProperty</code> and <code>owl:hasValue</code> properties, 
indicating the property/value pairs which must be true of matching 
agents.
</p>

<div class="example">
<pre>
&lt;!-- here we see a FOAF group described.
     each foaf group may be associated with an OWL definition 
     specifying the class of agents that constitute the group's membership --&gt;
&lt;foaf:Group&gt;
 &lt;foaf:name&gt;ILRT staff&lt;/foaf:name&gt;
 &lt;foaf:membershipClass&gt;
    &lt;owl:Class rdf:about="http://ilrt.example.com/groups#ILRTStaffPerson"&gt;
     &lt;rdfs:subClassOf rdf:resource="http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/Person"/&gt;
     &lt;rdfs:subClassOf&gt;
       &lt;owl:Restriction&gt; 
         &lt;owl:onProperty rdf:resource="http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/workplaceHomepage"/&gt;
         &lt;owl:hasValue rdf:resource="http://www.ilrt.bris.ac.uk/"/&gt;
       &lt;/owl:Restriction&gt; 
     &lt;/rdfs:subClassOf&gt;
   &lt;/owl:Class&gt;
 &lt;/foaf:membershipClass&gt;
&lt;/foaf:Group&gt;
</pre>
</div>
  

<p>
Note that while these example OWL rules for being in the eg:ILRTStaffPerson class are 
based on a <code>foaf:Person</code> having a particular 
<code>foaf:workplaceHomepage</code>, this places no obligations on the authors of actual 
FOAF documents to include this information. If the information <em>is</em> included, then 
generic OWL tools may infer that some person is an eg:ILRTStaffPerson. To go the extra 
step and infer that some eg:ILRTStaffPerson is a <code>foaf:member</code> of the group 
whose <code>foaf:name</code> is "ILRT staff", tools will need some knowledge of the way 
FOAF deals with groups. In other words, generic OWL technology gets us most of the way, 
but the full <code>foaf:Group</code> machinery requires extra work for implimentors.
</p>

<p>
The current design names the relationship as pointing <em>from</em> the group, 
to the member. This is convenient when writing XML/RDF that encloses the members within 
markup that describes the group. Alternate representations of the same content are 
allowed in RDF, so you can write claims about the Person and the Group without having to 
nest either description inside the other. For (brief) example:
</p>

<div class="example">
<pre>
&lt;foaf:Group&gt;
 &lt;foaf:member rdf:nodeID="libby"/&gt;
 &lt;!-- more about the group here --&gt;
&lt;/foaf:Group&gt;
&lt;foaf:Person rdf:nodeID="libby"&gt;
  &lt;!-- more about libby here --&gt;
&lt;/foaf:Person/&gt;
</div>

<p>
There is a FOAF <a href="http://rdfweb.org/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=8">issue tracker (8)</a> 
associated with this FOAF term. A design goal is to make the most of W3C's <a 
href="http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/WebOnt">OWL</a> language for representing group-membership 
criteria, while also making it easy to leverage existing groups and datasets available 
online (eg. buddylists, mailing list membership lists etc). Feedback on the current design 
is solicited!
