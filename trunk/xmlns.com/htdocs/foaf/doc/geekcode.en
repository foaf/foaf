<p>
The <code>foaf:geekCode</code> property is used to represent a 'Geek Code' for some 
<code>foaf:Person</code>. 
</p>

<p>
See the <a href="http://www.geekcode.com/geek.html">Code of the Geeks</a> specification for 
details of the code, which provides a somewhat frivolous and willfully obscure mechanism for 
characterising technical expertise, interests and habits. The <code>foaf:geekCode</code> 
property is not bound to any particular version of the code. The last published version 
of the code was v3.12 in March 1996.
</p>

<p>
As the <a href="http://www.geekcode.com/">Geek Code</a> website notes, the code played a small 
(but amusing) part in the history of the Internet. The <code>foaf:geekCode</code> property 
exists in acknowledgement of this history. It'll never be 1996 again.
</p>

<p>
Note that the Geek Code is a densely packed collections of claims about the person it applies 
to; to express these claims explicitly in RDF/XML would be incredibly verbose. The syntax of the 
Geek Code allows for '&lt;' and '&gt;' characters, which have special meaning in RDF/XML. 
Consequently these should be carefully escaped in markup.

<p>
An example Geek Code:
</p>
<p class="example">
    GED/J d-- s:++>:  a-- C++(++++) ULU++ P+ L++ E---- W+(-) N+++ o+ K+++ w--- O- M+ V-- PS++>$ 
PE++>$ Y++ PGP++ t- 5+++ X++ R+++>$ tv+ b+ DI+++ D+++ G++++ e++ h r-- y++** 
</p>

<p>
...would be written in FOAF RDF/XML as follows:
</p>

<p class="example">
&lt;foaf:geekCode&gt;
    GED/J d-- s:++&amp;gt;:  a-- C++(++++) ULU++ P+ L++ E---- W+(-) N+++ o+ K+++ 
    w--- O- M+ V-- PS++&amp;gt;$ PE++&amp;gt;$ Y++ PGP++ t- 5+++ X++ R+++&amp;gt;$ 
    tv+ b+ DI+++ D+++ G++++ e++ h r-- y++** 
&lt;/foaf:geekCode&gt;
