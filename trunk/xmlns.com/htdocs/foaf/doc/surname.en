<p>A number of naming constructs are under development to provide
naming substructure; draft properties include <code>foaf:firstName</code>,
<code>foaf:givenname</code>, and <code>foaf:surname</code>. These are not currently 
stable or consistent; see the <a href="http://rdfweb.org/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=7">issue 
tracker</a> for design discussions, status and ongoing work on rationalising the FOAF 
naming machinery.
</p>

<p>
There is also a simple <code>foaf:name</code> property.
