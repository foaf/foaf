<p>
The <code>foaf:maker</code> property relates something to a  
<code>foaf:Agent</code> that <code>foaf:made</code> it. As such it is an 
inverse of the <code>foaf:made</code> property.
</p>

<p>
The <code>foaf:name</code> (or other <code>rdfs:label</code>) of the 
<code>foaf:maker</code> of something can be described as the 
<code>dc:creator</code> of that thing.</p>

<p>
For example, if the thing named by the URI 
http://rdfweb.org/people/danbri/ has a 
<code>foaf:maker</code> that is a <code>foaf:Person</code> whose 
<code>foaf:name</code> is 'Dan Brickley', we can conclude that 
http://rdfweb.org/people/danbri/ has a <code>dc:creator</code> of 'Dan 
Brickley'. 
</p>

<p>
FOAF descriptions are encouraged to use <code>dc:creator</code> only for 
simple textual names, and to use <code>foaf:maker</code> to indicate 
creators, rather than risk confusing creators with their names. This 
follows most Dublin Core usage. See <a 
href="http://rdfweb.org/topic/UsingDublinCoreCreator">UsingDublinCoreCreator</a> 
for details.
