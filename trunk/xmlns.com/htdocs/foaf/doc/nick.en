<p>
The <code>foaf:nick</code> property relates a <code>foaf:Person</code> to a short (often 
abbreviated) nickname, such as those use in IRC chat, online accounts, and computer 
logins.
</p>

<p>
This property is necessarily vague, because it does not indicate any particular naming 
control authority, and so cannot distinguish a person's login from their (possibly 
various) IRC nicknames or other similar identifiers. However it has some utility, since 
many people use the same string (or slight variants) across a variety of such 
environments.
</p>

<p>
For specific controlled sets of names (relating primarily to Instant Messanger accounts), 
FOAF provides some convenience properties: <code>foaf:jabberID</code>, 
<code>foaf:aimChatID</code>, <code>foaf:msnChatID</code> and 
<code>foaf:icqChatID</code>. Beyond this, the problem of representing such accounts is not 
peculiar to Instant Messanging, and it is not scaleable to attempt to enumerate each 
naming database as a distinct FOAF property. 
</p>

<p>
Future work in this area may provide more specific terms for describing online accounts 
and related user data.
