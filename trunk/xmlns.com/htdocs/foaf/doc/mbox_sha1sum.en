<p>
A <code>foaf:mbox_sha1sum</code> of a <code>foaf:Person</code> is a textual representation of 
the result of applying the SHA1 mathematical functional to a 'mailto:' identifier (URI) for an 
Internet mailbox that they stand in a <code>foaf:mbox</code> relationship to.

<p>
In other words, if you have a mailbox (<code>foaf:mbox</code>) but don't want to reveal its 
address, you can take that address and generate a <code>foaf:mbox_sha1sum</code> representation 
of it. Just as a <code>foaf:mbox</code> can be used as an indirect identifier for its owner, we 
can do the same with <code>foaf:mbox_sha1sum</code> since there is only one 
<code>foaf:Person</code> with any particular value for that property.

<p>
Many FOAF tools use <code>foaf:mbox_sha1sum</code> in preference to exposing mailbox 
information. This is usually for privacy and SPAM-avoidance reasons. Other relevant techniques 
include the use of PGP encryption (see <a href="http://usefulinc.com/foaf/">Edd Dumbill's 
documentation</a>) and the use of <a 
href="http://www.w3.org/2001/12/rubyrdf/util/foafwhite/intro.html">FOAF-based whitelists</a> for 
mail filtering.

Code examples for SHA1 in C#, Java, PHP, Perl and Python can be found <a 
href="http://www.intertwingly.net/blog/1545.html">in Sam Ruby's 
weblog entry. Remember to include the 'mailto:' prefix, but no trailing 
whitespace, when computing a <code>foaf:mbox_sha1sum</code> property.
