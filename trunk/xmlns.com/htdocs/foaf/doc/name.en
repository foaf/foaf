<p>The <code>foaf:name</code> of something is a simple textual string.</p>

<p>
XML language tagging may be used to indicate the language of the name. For example:</p>

<blockquote>
&lt;foaf:name xml:lang="en"&gt;Dan Brickley&lt;/foaf:name&gt;
</blockquote>

<p>
FOAF provides some other naming constructs. These are under development. While foaf:name 
does not provide for substructure (family vs given etc.) it does provide a basic level of 
interoperability.
