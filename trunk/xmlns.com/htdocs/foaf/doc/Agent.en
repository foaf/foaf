<p>
The <code>foaf:Agent</code> class is the class of agents; things that do stuff. A well 
known sub-class is <code>foaf:Person</code>, representing people. Other kinds of agents 
include <code>foaf:Organization</code> and <code>foaf:Group</code>.

<p>
The <code>foaf:Agent</code> class is useful in a few places in FOAF where 
<code>foaf:Person</code> would have been overly specific. For example, the IM chat ID 
properties such as <code>jabberID</code> are typically associated with people, but 
sometimes belong to software bots.
