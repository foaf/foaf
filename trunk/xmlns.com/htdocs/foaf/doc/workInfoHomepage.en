<p>
The <code>foaf:workInfoHomepage</code> of a <code>foaf:Person</code> is a 
<code>foaf:Document</code> that describes their work. It is generally (but not necessarily) a 
different document from their <code>foaf:homepage</a>, and from any 
<code>foaf:workplaceHomepage</code>(s) they may have.

<p>
The purpose of this property is to distinguish those pages you often see, which describe 
someone's professional role within an organisation or project. These aren't really homepages, 
although they share some characterstics.
