<p>
The <code>foaf:Person</code> class represents people. Something is a 
<code>foaf:Person</code> if it is a person. We don't nitpic about whether they're 
alive, dead, real, or imaginary. The <code>foaf:Person</code> class is a sub-class of the 
<code>foaf:Agent</code> class, since all people are considered 'agents' in FOAF.
