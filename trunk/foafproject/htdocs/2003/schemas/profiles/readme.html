<h1>foaf syntactic schemas</h1>
<p>Explanation from Leigh Dodds follows:</p>
<hr />
<p>This package shows the specification (and implementation with
Schematron and XSLT) of three syntactic profiles, ie. document
formats, based on FOAF RDF/XML.</p>
<dl>
<dt>foaf-image.sch</dt>
<dd>Simple, restricted syntax for a format for publishing lists of
images. Images must have title and creator, and must depict at
least one foaf:Person. foaf:Person elements restricted to seeAlso
and mbox_sha1sum.</dd>
<dt>foaf-basic.sch</dt>
<dd>...</dd>
<dt>foaf-minimal.sch</dt>
<dd>...</dd>
</dl>
<p><a href="../profiles/">The package includes</a> the following
files:</p>
<dl>
<dt>build.xml</dt>
<dd>Ant build script to generate FOAF-Basic and FOAF-Minimal
validators; includes schematron compilation step</dd>
<dt>schema.rdf</dt>
<dd>copy of FOAF Schema</dd>
<dt>/schema</dt>
<dd>basic schemas</dd>
<dt>/xsl</dt>
<dd>stylesheets to generate Schematron assertions based on poking
around in the schema. E.g. all literals, all properties of
foaf:Agent/foaf:Person, etc.</dd>
<dt>/out</dt>
<dd>final versions of the schema incorporating data from
transforms.</dd>
<dt>profiles.txt</dt>
<dd>notes on profiles</dd>
<dt>ldodds.rdf</dt>
<dd>test file, with some deliberately broken bits.</dd>
</dl>
<p>We also have Valid and invalid test documents. Notice that
foaf:minimal.rdf also validates as foaf-basic.rdf as you'd
expect.</p>
<p>just run "ant" to build them both. If you want to make manual
changes change the versions under /schema.</p>
<h3>Notes from Leigh</h3>
<p>This is probably overkill, but it saved me manually typing in a
bunch of property names. Should be possible to re-generate them if
the schema changes as well, so thats an additional benefit. Would
be easy to adapt this to only include properties with a particular
version label as well, e.g. FOAF-Minimal with only stable
properties. Further parameterising the stylesheets would also allow
this to be generalised to other vocabularies, so there may be some
additional mileage.</p>
<p>foaf-basic and foaf-minimal schemas are probably complete enough
for demoing purposes.</p>
<p>They may not be as strict as they might be, but without clearer
specification of the syntax constraints it's hard to know where to
go next. Happy to add more constraints if you think of 'em, or
based on discussions. See schema comments for a list of implemented
constraints.</p>
<p>Hopefully this meets your needs. I can also look at a RELAX NG
versions of the schemas (in fact I think that they could also be
done with DTDs, no really complicated constraints) if you think
that's necessary, but the Schematron versions make better online
validator tools methinks.</p>
<p>This has been an interesting exercise. Makes me wonder whether
it would be possible to generalise the stylesheets I created to
grab lists of properties from the schema into a more general
framework. If syntactic profiles become common-place (and I'm
beginning to wonder whether this subset/fork/syntax debate is going
to recur for any popular RDF format!) then the may also be mileage
in defining a way to declaratively say, "these classes and
properties are valid in this profile". Based on my tinkerings here,
this looks possible.</p>
<h3>Issues and Bugs</h3>
<p>There is also a "tests" target but this breaks with the same
error you were getting. Am wondering if this is a bug in the parser
-- Schemas work fine with the Topologi XML Validator tool.</p>

<h3>Profile Descriptions (draft)</h3>

<p>
There are various kinds of RDF/XML document that use FOAF. Here we try to 
characterise some particular use cases, so that syntactic schemas, test data etc. 
can be produced.
</p>

<h4>FOAF-Minimal</h4>
<p>
Minimally useful FOAF. Basically just a series of 
properties about a person. Should allow only a single 
foaf:Person, any properties associated with foaf:Person 
or foaf:Agent, no elements from other namespaces, no 
other foaf elements, including foaf:knows.
</p>
<p>
Sort of like vCard but using FOAF. 
</p>

<h4>FOAF-Basic</h4>

<p>
"FOAF-a-Matic FOAF". Above, but relaxes the restrictions 
on foaf:knows, allowing other people to be included, as 
nested elements only. Again no elements from other namespaces, 
no other foaf elements.
</p>
<p>
Lot of FOAF out there falls in this category (intentionally or by accident).
</p>

<h4>FOAF-Classic</h4>

<p>FOAF is all its glorious variability. Any RDF/XML document using FOAF (eg. 
annotated RSS feeds) would also count.
</p>

<h4>FOAF-Image</h4>
<p>Lists of Images, depictions</p>

<h4>FOAF-Biblio</h4>
<p>Lists of Documents, makers</p>
