<h3>Changes</h3>

<ul>
   <li>23rd July 2002 -- 0.6. Added ability to include seeAlso FOAF descriptions. Added refer a friend capability. If the following URL parameters are given, then they are
   used to automatically populate the details of the first friend: <code>name</code>, <code>email</code>, <code>seealso</code></li>
   <li>19th July 2002 -- 0.5. mbox_sha1sum calculation was using raw email address without adding 'mailto:' prefix. Thanks to Sampo Syreeni. Corrected
   serialization of friend data -- People elements weren't being wrapped in a 'knows' element. Thanks to Edd Dumbill. Added ability to switch
   spam protection on and off. Added a 'What Next?' section.</li>
   <li>12th July 2002 -- 0.4. Fixed bug that was incorrectly producing mbox_sha1sum as an RDF resource. Thanks to Jim Ley and Dan Brickley.
   <li>11th July 2002 -- 0.3. Reworked all Javascript, separating out helper objects and functions (foaf.js) and form processing (foaf-a-matic.js). Added more FOAF properties,
   including schoolHomepage, workInfoHomepage, phone, firstName, surname, title. Also added mbox_sha1sum as suggested by danbri, using Paul
   Johnston's <a href="http://pajhome.org.uk/crypt/md5/">SHA1 implementation for Javascript</a>. Multiple friends can now be added. Added an introduction.</li>
   <li>10th July 2002 -- 0.2. Fixed missing 'mailto:' prefix on friends mbox and typo (workhomepage => workplaceHomepage); gained a <a href="http://jibbering.com/2002/7/foaf.html">mirror</a>(! :) which demonstrates some improvements.</li>
