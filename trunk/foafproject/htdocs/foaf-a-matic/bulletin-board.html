There's a need for a simple way to link together FOAF descriptions. One way is to simply link to other
FOAF documents using the <code>rdfs:seeAlso</code> element. However for this to work at least
one document in that graph must be being harvested by a spider, e.g. the <a href="http://usefulinc.com/foaf/foafbot">FOAFbot</a>.
Which is not ideal.
</p>

<p>
Here's a quick and dirty proposal for how to allow the community to bootstrap itself into a network of FOAF descriptions
by allowing the collaborative editing of a FOAF document index:
</p>

<ol>

<li>
I've created a <a href="http://rdfweb.org/rweb/wiki/wiki.pl?FOAFBulletinBoard">FOAFBulletinBoard</a> page on the RDFWeb Wiki. Anyone can go to that page and add their name and a link to
their FOAF description. Easy.
</li>

<li>
This page can then be run through the <a href="http://cgi.w3.org/cgi-bin/tidy">W3C HTML Tidy service</a> to create a well-formed XHTML page. Here's <a href="http://cgi.w3.org/cgi-bin/tidy?docAddr=http%3A%2F%2Frdfweb.org%2Frweb%2Fwiki%2Fwiki.pl%3FFOAFBulletinBoard">a link that
does that</a>.
</li>

<li>
This document can then be transformed with <a href="http://www.ldodds.com/foaf/bulletin.xsl">a simple XSLT stylesheet</a> to produce an RDF document containing a <code>rdfs:seeAlso</code>
element for each FOAF description linked from the original page. The <a href="http://www.w3.org/2001/05/xslt">W3C XSLT service</a> can do this for us.
</li>

<li>
The results of this transformation can then be used as an entry point for FOAF indexing engines. Here's <a href="http://www.w3.org/2000/06/webdata/xslt?xslfile=http://www.ldodds.com/foaf/bulletin.xsl&xmlfile=http://cgi.w3.org/cgi-bin/tidy?docAddr=http%3A%2F%2Frdfweb.org%2Frweb%2Fwiki%2Fwiki.pl%3FFOAFBulletinBoard">the final URL</a> that combines
both the Tidy and XSLT transformations.
</li>

</ol>

<p>
The beauty of this is that anyone can add to the list, and additional Bulletin Boards can be linked from other Wiki pages around
the web.

<b>Update:</b> thanks to Aaron Swartz for pointing out the problems with bulletin.xsl (rdf:seeAlsos not being attached to anything,
and providing a corrected stylesheet.
